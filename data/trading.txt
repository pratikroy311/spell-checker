all right let's get to it uh I'll give everybody a minute to get back
how's everybody uh doing by the way everybody holding up okay um comments questions anything
's a lot of theory by the way they were going over a ton of theory layers and uh less technical analysis
more about strategy more about creating expectations more about just starting to understand the uh the foundation and the
roots of how we can use strategy to make more money in the markets because really that's the missing component for a lot of people
it's why I'm doing such a big focus on now on it lately like with mental analysis too right like there's mental
analysis and strategy like I said earlier in this lesson are are too huge combine those two and it's uh probably
why most people who are seeing trades that aren't going their way are healing
that after data points polarity is the second most important part of butterfly effect
have to rank the importance of of them I think all of butterfly effect is important uh Butterfly Effect even needs
to be broken into two different courses it's so important like what we learn in Butterfly Effect is
kind of the opening to comparative analysis and not even really getting deeper into the heavy theorem in it so I
think you know if you were to talk about all 74 lessons in Butterfly Effect you know the reason we teach that or the
reason I teach data points right at the start is because it's the foundation everything it's understanding that comparative analysis exists and it's
real I rank something after that I don't even know if I'd rank data points the most
important I would rank like I've said I would in the past and I guess I would but it would be a different type of
most important I would say it's the most it would if there would be a bunch of awards what's the best lesson what is
the lesson that will garnish you the most money what's the most important lesson what is the lesson you have to
watch twice like I think there's a lot of boxes you could fit a lot of these lessons into to say what's the most
important would almost and and without any other consideration to like what are what are some of the other major things what is the Turning
Point lesson for most people where is The X Factor in Butterfly Effect there's so many there's okay yeah data points
most important lesson because if you miss it you want to understand the entire course but that doesn't mean it's the best I don't think
there's at the best you know what I mean yeah I don't think there would be a best lesson second most important oh man
that's almost like a loaded like I said that's kind of a that's loaded that's that's too much of a loaded question because it implies that there's other
things that aren't highly valuable in different ways I would I would say that that can't be
answered I would call it the data points the most important lesson because without data points you won't understand any of it
um it would also call what we're doing now active and passive contracts
I would call that the most overlooked lesson because the value of active and passive contracts really becomes the
opening segment or the opening the uh what would you call that at the
beginning of the book not the introduction but they have something before that anyways it would be the introduction to understanding
polarity uh polarity is probably the most valuable point of butterfly
affecting them that's not true because chart architecture is how do you even Define the most valuable point I would say the most overlooked lesson
is probably active and passive contracts because there's a deeper understanding there that I simply wouldn't go into
just making a video in layman's terms there's a much deeper understanding there that presets the entirety of of
everything to come after it trigger points ranges so the most overlooked lesson is absolutely active and passive
contracts I would put that title there the points one day at a time ranges polarity yeah one day at a time is
important but one day at a time kind of ends a chapter it's like okay we learned levels let's do this stuff one day at a
time it's kind of the end of a chapter right like it's really important people see one day at a time because it's very connectable to people
people learn this material and uh it's it's very it's very hard to learn which
I'm out like I said earlier I'm going to make Tick Tock videos on that and IG videos on on how you learn better in the
upcoming week but like one day at a time kind of ties everything into this simple formula and people like simple people
like something they can follow so as a teacher somebody who um has to find the best most optimized
way to to show people how to learn preface yeah there you go thanks
um one day at a time is a great lesson and most people see it as the best lesson and all of butterfly effect because one day at a time shows them oh
slow down this is easy there is a system after all this is how we can do it like it's it very much connects with people
on that layer where it can be application but application applied improperly is still a shitty traitor you
know what I mean so application used at a percentage of what it's supposed to be used that is it still
equates to like a Trader um not to say people at one day at a time or should Traders just to put into
perspective why one day at a time it's a great lesson but it's more for people and less for
learning that lesson um it becomes the opening arguments or the preface into understanding strategy
and then active and passive contracts allow you to understand polarity which really should be the starting point of any ladder when ladders create ranges or
arranges created prior to a ladder and a ladder contest by Deep diving a whole level to create another ladder point
which is respecting a range which is creating a trend and all that is created off of active and passive contracts so
by understanding active and passive contracts you understand the very first step in and all of the the
the theory they're after so active and passive contracts is heavy in
theory on purpose for this reason but if you understand it you can then start to
understand and justify hey latter points these make sense and people say oh how do you see 29.2 well it's easy technically to see 29 too but to make
that decision of why it can move up when I back when I said you know 29 244 or whatever and hit 29 242 it was two
dollars off the Target before it does this run up to 60k like so there's a reason a deeper theory
that allows me to understand it so active and passive contracts definitely the most overlooked because it's kind of
the opening arguments the the the preface or the uh the statement that
by understanding it at a deeper level you can make more sense out of every lesson going forward so it's kind of
important in that way to go through it a second time with a deeper understanding because if it's like a level up to all
the other Theory when you understand it it levels up all your other theories you may understand trigger points
but if you understand active and passal contracts trigger points become 10 times more valuable you may get ladder points
and ranges by understanding active and passive contracts and the formula that's used those become 10 times more powerful
and valuable as well you see so active and passive contracts well maybe heavy in theory really is The X Factor for the
other things but by itself it's useless but as it should be because it's a form like like I showed you guys earlier I
see it as a formula and the way that it works and then you can understand bigger parts of the market
I feel like you're still getting better from teaching this stuff it seems like these aspects are so fundamental for you
um I mean I've done this a long time so I guess I just always tell people let's see
it's the mark of how you see um somebody really knows what they're talking about how deep they can go into
the theory because I've I've seen people try to teach my stuff before and it's always kind of not old and I mean it's just like with
anything in life you truly understand if somebody knows deepest roots of something the way that they can describe
it to others because in order to be able to describe it you have to understand it at a very intimate level that's something that you've
been working with either a lifetime or something that you have tens of thousands of hours in or I don't
know if I'm still learning stuff be I'm learning how to become a better teacher all the time um recently I've I've learned that
there are certain cues that I have to pick up on my students in order to direct the content and before I just had
a plan I just had a plan to direct content now I look at my students I analyze them and it's much more of a
dynamic system that I create before it was very static it was okay release this course release that course release this
course it was a very specific plan that I had right now it's more of a dynamic understanding so I have a plan of things
I want to release and I dynamicize the release dates by understanding what my
students need the most so I guess that's a way I'm learning how to become a better teacher right now is finding the points where people need
help and then I already have the plan in place to release the material anyways it's like okay which order does this come out in and that's where I'm getting
better I feel like I've really done a good job of that recently in this past three months of looking at the mentee students
and taking over overall look uh introducing mental analysis the Mind Training Center
the way I'm in which I'm releasing material everything seems to be clicking together in such an organic perfect way for people which is good
I'm gonna catch up on chat from a lot of sense a few months ago I listen to a big Market with Vancouver how they use big
liquidity to move markets the way they want it to build their any positions they can't with only one that's why you
see ladders I guess yeah absolutely for sure so I know you can't always get your positions filled it depends on the size like it's it's hard
Edge mode trading yeah I think hedge mode is great it's highest level for sure but it's it's great it's they're very professional level
okay what else did I miss uh you guys are talking about the ad nice
no problem I get it I think I get it thanks
yeah we got done the order flow of your lessons is beyond excellent yeah I've always had that um
in mind like what which what which way to teach people oh because it's very tough because I have my demised formula
and in my head this this big picture like inside my brain is like this uh
like a scene out of a movie it's like a 50 chalkboards all on this big 80-foot wall and they're all like formula here
formula I've got all these different pieces of the charts and pieces of information compartmentalized so I can make the most sense out of them quickly
the way my mind works very much like photographic memory but combining that with uh
Parts I always screw this word up Earth mentalization compartmental
art happens to everybody I know you try to say compartmentalization without making
it sound stupid impartamental compartmental compartmental I don't know anyways
doesn't matter I always screw this word up like all these chalkboards are to mentalized
in my mind and yeah it's like picking which chalkboard comes next is important so yeah the
order flow is definitely something I focused on let's see yeah you guys are saying it out loud now you guys are doing the same
thing art mentalization there you go dude I see is like 500 IQ for uh huge
yeah yes it's a tough one I mean this takes all the turning points
to create the yeah yeah the data like it's so important these this lesson it's it's so heavy in theory but it it's what
creates like the uh the first brick it's it's the mortar before you lay the foundation right like it's literally the
first brick and rebar where you uh build a house or you create your concrete form you have to play like a footing of
concrete with rebar in it that that's what this is it's like the concrete footing
let's see I've always been lazy to learn your material turns my mind on another level I rarely experience Beyond patience that's so awesome thank you so
much man that's such a compliment um I'm going to be talking about how we learn better in the next week in in my
my uh Tick Tock uh release it just guys really pay attention to that because I'm gonna say it here as for you guys first
but and I talked about a bit about this before cognitive strain is the way our mind works best so this is why
universities work so well to teach us because cognitive strain is when our mind learns system two which is our
logical mind is very very lazy it doesn't activate unless it has to system one drives everything that we have in
life maybe I'll talk a bit about this today on stream instead of wasting our time yeah I'll talk a bit about this on
stream today but anyways I'll give you guys the good stuff which is we learn under cognitive strain so when our mind
is pushed to its absolute limit and it's burning out that's when the brain learns because it forces itself and take the
knowledge so it can get through the moment so it it mobilizes under cognitive strain and it mobilizes under
stupidity so
where's font in history you'll never forget this image because there's something that happens to the Mind
you'll also never forget this image what's the worst font you've ever seen bleeding Cowboys that will now forever
be burned into your brain bleeding Cowboys because when something is so grotesquely bad it forces system two to
mobilize when it becomes so confused as to why system one which is your emotional layer is having a connection
with this system one creates confusion because it's just so ugly that system two it forces it to mobilize it forces
your logical layer to activate overused bleeding Cowboy font not too oh
boy one down the rabbit hole so system two which is your logical layer mobilizes under cognitive strain and
under extreme stupidity it's why so much YouTube content has so many clicks because the only time people learn is
when the material is horrible the shittier the material and they've done studies on this the shittier the material and the uglier the the fonts
and the worse the colors are the better people learn because it forces system 2 to activate by rejecting the confusion
of system one this is the way the psychological mind works shittier the material the better people learn
the more you strain the mind the better people learn so those are the two pretexts as to where the Mind operates
at its best and intakes information so good it's why so many people have to go through butterfly effect so many times
because one time through it's not enough they just kind of whatever until you have cognitive strain
system two doesn't mobilize so this is why University works so well because it forces you into these ridiculous
routines where your mind is so drained that it forces the brain to to learn
called cognitive strain it's called learning under extremes and when system
um one has this feeling of ooh disgust it's why people learn because it forces
system two The Logical layer to mobilize to make sense of a confusing moment so it forces your mind to learn
you go on YouTube look at the cringiest effing thumbnails that give you the most gross reactions
they'll have the highest views because it forces the mind to learn imagine seeing a thumbnail imagine going and
searching for something uh whatever imagine going and searching for something
oops I press play Imagine going for and and searching for something on and seeing this ridiculous thumbnail
that's so ugly you're like oh my God this is so crap I need to see what this
is about isn't that like the first reaction you guys get you need to learn what it's about why is this so ugly it's
like watching you know that famous saying like oh um train is crashing and I can't stop watching
it's so bad it forces the mind to watch it's like it's it's so you could make
like hyper shitty thumbnails and you'd get more views so it's like a mind trick that you can
do but it's not really a good one because it's like at the you're basically selling your soul to take advantage of the Mind
and if you ever wonder why you look at something that's so bad it's like watching a train crash that that famous saying it's why it happens
the shittier the material the better you learn because it forces the mind to question it forces the mind to say God this is so disgusting I need to see
what's going on haven't you guys ever noticed that about like tick tock yo watch the ones that piss you off the most the longest
you guys ever like scroll down tick tocks and like you're so pissed off it allures you in
Rick Astley I don't even know who that is I'll take your word for it
I wonder where humans are dumb reminds me of pressure which builds up from procrastination I can be motivated but
the goal is the things all is to do the things
one needs to oh yeah Rick Astley um Rick Rolled right
that's that's that's why the Mind does that that's why we watch things that's why the the saying I want to watch the
train crash or whatever it is like you just want to see the world burn just want to see the world crash the more
emotion that's involved the more disgust that's there the more it forces the mind to learn so the shittier the material the more attention it has
uh you can see it in thumbnails you can see it on social media you can see it on on Twitter the most stupid thumbnail
makes your brain like question what's happening and then and then you click it to justify that Injustice to justify
that discussed it's again it's just human psychology it's the way the mind works so cognitive strain and
material that's when your brain works that's when it learns so if you're not straining yourself on this material you won't learn it if you go watch it once
it kind of that's why you have to go multiple passes on my courses because they're too dense in material and you have to go through cognitive strain in
order to intake it properly because there's no sellout content if I put a bunch of thumbnails and weird
pictures it would force you to pay attention because your mind Rejects rejects the emotion of disgust and and
frustration it rejects that so it forces The Logical mind to mobile
okay let's continue on that's fun fact though for you guys that's how you learn this is something where
you have to understand the difference of what makes something move between active positions opening and current contracts
closing because that will help you see where your targets are to understand that is to also go like this and say
if I was now we're going to delete some of these levels as well let's go with this one we don't need this one anymore
we don't need this one anymore and we certainly don't need this one well this one's not bad it's the whole level it's
fine if I was in this trade and I had entered this whole level here and I would see
this is Target I would simply be entering here exiting here and possibly opening up a new short if I had the time
and I would be targeting My Level below which is the exact move that I went to I'll double down here the part of its
range that's represented right so you know the part the part of its range that it goes after
you quickly see where these contracts the difference between active contracts
which are new positions opening because you should have new positions opening here and here as well as you should have
in that same moment not only active contracts
opening but you have contracts closing at the same time so that's that's what creates these things and their ability
to hold is where the true Target is you'll have a Confluence of not only active but closing trades you'll have
new active positions opening on those levels like we buy hold levels because those are active positions we also Target whole levels to close our
positions because those are closing positions and this this greatly helps with defining targets
understanding where we should be buying and selling because this is the Confluence that's created that stops these things from moving
active and passive if you want to call them passive so active contracts opening
and passive contracts that are already open that need to close or closing contracts so so active
I'll write that on the screen because it sounds confusing so you have active oops ah not like this
we have active contracts happening and passive slash closing because passive
and closing are the same thing it's a passive contract because it's open until it's closed or it's a closing contract
right so you have both of these have things happening in this moment both of these things happening in this moment
this is what creates levels to hold okay so this creates the levels to hold
oh boy what am I doing let's try this again round two
active contracts opening right
nope not that one not that one this one copy paste good
and passive and closing contracts here right so passive contracts are the contracts that lose money unless Target
is hit passive and closing contracts are are what comp what make up a move right
this this is what makes this move happen like as I'm scrubbing this passive and and closing
texture this is the range that makes this possible as to where active right but theoretically passive and closing
contracts are happening everywhere like technically if you had somebody who was like a master scalper so you know you
have this level right here which is the top of the range on on this they could
open up an active position there open another active position here while
passive and closing this position up here so you have a duality of actions that happen which actually compounds and moves and makes that job that's how the
big players work right they talked about today has a passive contracts on every single level and those active and passive contracts are closed
appropriated to the actions that are happening in the market or the the architecture that's developed in the market is is the the decision of passive
closing contracts so actually the big players never have
non-passive trades they always have passive trades open because this passive
trade here or I should say this trade that is becomes active in it's my drawing tool this trade that
becomes active here is a passive trade it closes on this level also opening up
a new active on this level at the same time so it's a double injection of volume and then those two same things happen up here active and passive so
technically biggest players or or the ones who really know what they're doing always have passive contracts open 24 7.
never ends because the levels they're selling they're also rebuying so they are literally selling
opening selling opening selling opening selling opening so there's always a contract open
so if you're really good you'll always have a contract open so that's something this drives towards is to constantly have
that's a tough thing to do that's no easy feat this is you know you're talking about chart Mastery that is
nailing every level 100 but but really the point being is that if this is your
target you should be in a trade until it hits and if you think this is what's going to pull it back you should also be
shorting that level so not only should you be closing a contract but you should also be opening a new contract there and
then this level down here would be your target from up here and you should actively be closing and opening a new
contract there the problem becomes when you're wrong because you quickly wash
away all of your profits so so whatever you made here if you made three percent here and you re-long on 100x here if
you're wrong you still make three percent but you instantly forfeit 100 of it because you are wrong and it liquidated your move right so
there's a punishment being wrong but also an invaluable reward for being right by marking these levels properly
so active and passive contracts are the way in which we can decipher what's happening in the moment you know after
that we can simply go back to this and we get rid of all this we simply go to our replay tool here
go to one minute charts and let this thing move and and you'll for yourselves see where the contracts are closing like
all the moves holding we're starting to close contracts it's stabilizing even even more active
trades are now stabilizing the move so when do the passive trades close out and say oh this is actually holding we need to exit our trades right there's a
moment there that that happens and it's right there
oh sorry I had my mic muted I muted it because I um coughed I forgot okay so
what I was saying is that um just just uh just a quick note on on this and what Jason had mentioned
earlier about not understanding where to close a trade um say you open a short here and uh it's
gonna kind of be a repeat of what I said earlier but again still important to highlight you open a short here because it's a level
you create a subset a set of sub strategies of what can happen whether you're going to take your target here
um whether you're going to use this whole level as your guide to stop gaining the trade doesn't mean you need to take your trade
Target here you can the decision becomes yours I think that the clear outcome here becomes like this like you could
you could take this as your Target but I want to see if this is going to break down to a lower level so instead of you know taking that 40 or 50 percent that
uh jsic talks about oh I took 40 I'm not too sure if this was correct or incorrect you could simply use a trend
as your trigger so this level gets hit and holds um Trend Trend uh is is like this so you
have Trend Trend breaks and and then you have like this maybe looks like a five minute hold here is or like a three
minute hole level um you get out of the trade on this candle here because this is this candle here is clearly going to be the breakout
moment so then that just becomes understanding where your passive contract should close because you've opened an active short here it's hit the
level right the level is is something that you don't want to see like oh I want to take 140 because it usually goes
down to this range so you don't have to exit on this on this level but what you do have to do is understand where your
passive contracts need to close right you guys have sound yeah you guys sound I can see it on my uh on my bar now I
just had my mic muted so so the next thing becomes okay let's draw a trend um if we break Trend and the level we
have two criterias here so we would have a trend like this and if Trend breaks we also need to break the level and and the
second that the level breaks is when you get out of the trade um that would be the way that you minimize the amount of money you leave
on the table if you're if you're waiting for it to go down so so identifying that you're in a passive contract and what
those possible trigger points could be that release you from your your passive contract is is is just how you do that
it's the way that you can can constantly stay in a move and um you both your
trigger points are released the whole level and the trend that's created so that you know just to go over j6 comment
again that's the way you would do that which we'll learn more about new shorts open which just makes the problem worse
for those shorts right the new shorts that open just make it even worse right the second goal at this thing is like even worse because now they're gonna
feel this move as soon as it goes over this level any new active positions that open will quickly close because like the
reality is if you have an active short open here which you should that's why we have the level marked I believe yellow is a four hour so this looks like the
four hour trade you have an active short open here um doesn't mean you need to open an island and then you have new
active trades executing it here you'd have an active short and what would you use as your guys you have both
you're already seeing that a range is developing so you could use this like Trend like this right you could use that Trend like that both events happening at
one you haven't entered your trade yet that's as simple as that there's your choices right there's your trade you've
got that level from down here creating this trend like this like it looks like a trend like that or if not you could just attach these two as as your trigger
point if this continues to hold the move you know that your passive has to close which is enough to make this move go the other direction
any chart you look at you can see there it is it's still holding right it's still holding
uh you actually wouldn't be out of this trade yet now you'd have to adapt there must be a little hard to do on the fly
but that's fine same thing um because this to here looks like it wouldn't have had hard
clothes there would have just been here and uh you could either stop gained right here
or you would still be in the trade he's actually everybody else again it's kind of hard to tell without the Trends on our charts we're gonna sit there inside
just eyeballs second we get under this we're going to start closing contracts so the second this
open contracts open contracts yeah they are smart they close a contract open contracts open open lungs open lungs
open lungs open lungs also opening Longs up here because these people are thinking it's going to move up all these
open lungs second it goes under this price you have an influx of those closing so you have a quick little pullback and then you have new Longs now
that's that polarity in the move right that's how you identify that that's a polarity where you get that happening and then I think you just end up
breaking Trend here I think you end up looks like what breaks Trend right here like this little line right here looks
like it's like a trend from down here this move holds below I started this move all of a sudden these guys start to
exit and then everybody's exiting because they're getting liquidated so then and it goes
right down you can see this on the charts like they they communicated to you you can read what people are doing through through
watching these levels and how they visually are developing in the moment right like the visual development of these
levels it's showing to you it's very very straightforward and you can see where volume is about to come in if you
understand the way in which active and passive contracts work
and then so the same thing down here right you have people who are in these shorts up here right not only not only are comments
they're opening the yellow lines such as compound four to four here not only is the move already broken because the
people who are long who are who the people who long this actually broke their own moves as silly as that sounds because nothing had to happen just a
lack of Longs coming in means that all of these Longs that came in on this level a lack of longs to pull this move
up right a lack of lungs actually means these lungs will all start to exit which is what breaks this move down and then
active positions open here and then oh you guys are now seeing how you're understanding that's how the polarity
gets created when when Act of Longs close active positions when a cancels a
polarity is true that's what you're seeing here like that formula I gave you guys earlier of active lungs a
the a when when passive is false a consoles a so active long-term into
active shorts because p is false which is uh passive and it creates polarity in a
move that's exactly what we described earlier that you're seeing here as fast as they got in
then they just get out faster than they can even think that's what happens
and then you have stuff like this stuff like this where you fall off a cliff so the important thing to know here is
imagine how many long positions opened right here and how many of them will close once once you start to breach this
level because in one way this looks like it's holding it does look like it's holding level but in the other sense like a large and how many contracts are
going to close once you lose active insurance
so 70 minutes or whatever we'll just call it an hour an hour of Long's
opening and the only people who took the shorts are like here and here and these shorts came in from like way the heck
back there all of this new stuff here that opened imagine how how hard this thing is going to get hit once
this loses this moment here an hour of longs it only takes one minute of shorts to to kill a move an hour of lungs geez
imagine what that could do to a move that's not moving up that's the key wording right there like
I have to break this down into layman's terms for people on the same okay uh an hour of Longs but really I
say one key thing there imagine how how hard this thing is going
to get hit once this loses this moment here an hour of longs it only takes one minute of shorts
to to kill a move an hour of lungs geez imagine what that could do to a move that's not moving up imagine what could
happen if something's not moving up the passive contracts so that that's often you guys will hear me say
um it has to continue moving up at this point this is why this is why I say that
I've said it on stream before I've said it in lessons it has to continue moving up if it doesn't want to dump it's kind
of weird kind of counter-intuitive like isn't it laddering no no the onus is for it to move up because the act of
contracts will start closing against themselves and then that creates a passive failure so this is why I say
that sometimes when I say it this thing has to move up now it's not about it laddering there's a point where a ladder
breaks Itself by not moving up so something may look like it's laddering in one time frame or on a chart it may
look like it's indeed laddering up but it actually has to continue to move up so that that ladder doesn't break
there's kind of like a deeper Theory with uh active and passive contracts and how they how they work to break ladders
like the breaking of a ladder like oh it's laddering up yeah well the breaking of a ladder happens when something refuses to move up because it's all all
about passive and active contract so why sometimes you guys hear me say oh it has to move has to continue visually
sometimes the reason because we can see it happening on the charts
but really that doesn't Aid us in our decisions to make where we open these contracts rather
what it does is it allows us to understand it's collapsing so it protects us from making bad entries
and also verifying what we something isn't going up anymore it's not about it laddering the the moment it loses that
momentum it becomes like the trigger point for active for Passive contracts to close their act those think is about
to happen so it's really interesting to watch even if we go right now in the moment let's just see where we are right now Layman's
versus actuality um exit the replayer tool yeah I would imagine there's a bulk of
shorts happening right here uh right here I'd imagine there's a bulk of
shorts but do you guys remember a few weeks ago when I said whatever range breaks you can also hold you down that's
what you're seeing here this is the range of brake suit it's also what can hold down the next move so I don't know if you guys remember
when I said that but when I first had this level marked it was back here um what creates your range is also the
polarity Point backside for the next range round that's just what you're seeing here anything just kind of interesting to see these things always
just kind of work together in harmony it's just all of that is going to close once we get above that so then you just
have your Trend players right here's one the first round of it right here right there's a first round thus you now
have Cycles Clarity points that create cycles and how Cycles can get created on a deep side Etc you've got this one
right here start to understand active and passive contracts so what breaks ranges you then have the liberation of Cycles which is really neat because now
you're talking about such a basic formula of Cycles accumulation and distributions like the ones that got in
here back to active and passive contracts to here now the beginning you've got beginning
the theory the formula it's really neat and it's really cool
long right here imagine really beautiful location this whole entire piece is basically going to short this thing find
these little nuggets that I drop here and there and then all of a sudden you see them it's like oh you can already see it like if we don't quickly get over
top of this right here like if we don't get over something like this and again these are just little local trends that are just kind of you know we're just
drawing them for this example if we don't get over top of this shorts will start to close so when you when you cross this trend
here guess what's going to happen right if you can't if you if you don't have like this is
another moment here it's like this your shorts closed when do Longs close that's going to be the first thing after
this lesson you're going to go don't open here God I don't know it's really interesting because it works
on both sides this becomes a really interesting thing you'll have with you in a coming week or two because this is
going to be best entry right you'll start looking at at these these charts and you'll be like oh it must be a lot
of passive Longs from back here when are they going to close you'll start asking yourself and then you're gonna say oh I wonder how many passive Longs closed
here look at the chart right now and you'll say oh I wonder how many passive Longs closed there and then and then you'll
sit here and you'll say okay so some passive Longs just close there to uh to reactivate here to re-passive long there
I wonder how many I wonder how many passive shorts are gonna close to create new Longs and then when the new Longs are coming I wonder how many passive
long it becomes this constant battle back and forth that you'll ask yourself for the rest of your trading career is where I wonder where the passes and the
actives are going like you wonder you'll start putting your your brain into other like you'll almost like you put your brain on a plateau and say oh
where's their brain what is it doing here what they're what are they doing right like you'll start saying what are they doing and they they become a
character in your own uh story they become the the enemy the the villain of your own justifications under where
they're closing it becomes really interesting because then you can really start to understand the charts and now you're talking about
you know human psychology and trying to to dissect what happens at these points of polarity psychology wise so it
becomes really interesting because then you go down this further trail of of the mind and how the you know the decisions
they make but then it's also tied together with a formula but you know human beings are still human beings so
they have influencers right but the best of them don't because they they know this stuff but it's a it's really cool
because it really oh yeah Steve bass said exactly what I was about to say it really allows you to see what's happening on the charts and he said it's
really allows you to see what's happening behind the scenes that creates the charts yeah it's really interesting uh it becomes its own metagame in itself
and the psychology behind trading um which is created off data points and the data points are created create new
psychology points so the data points actually come first and the data points are derived off of a formula and the
formula can exist under certain pretenses of trues and falses that go down a logic tree which create
um psychology points which create a psychology map so data points created a psychological map of decisions like it
then it goes into another huge branching of decisions between psychology points so now you guys are going to go on these
charts over the next two weeks and you're going to start saying hmm I wonder where passives are closing why would they
close passives there so now you're trying to like understand their mind so now you're down down the psychology hole but you're using data points to make
those assertations you're using the data points to figure those things out and you're saying oh well interesting uh
jeez so what happened here oh I know what happened here all these Longs from
here close there so where are these Longs going to close oh I suppose I need to find their range okay so where's
polarity this is the actual point polarity can exist back on its point which means it kind of has to hit this
whole level it has to break below this whole level so actually when you lose this whole level that's the polarity of this range so actually you should go
back and test the bottom parts of its range if it can't hold this and you're going to say oh well then that's fine so
that's where this polarity is created what about the polarity up top what about here what what passive contracts close there all these ones close there
okay interesting so what could be the event where the next set of passive contracts here didn't have enough time
to get out where could they get out so then you're saying I wore the lungs eggs for the shorts exit it was really
interesting it's really interesting because because it comes this bigger justification and understanding the way the mind works and optimizing and the
the strategy behind the markets and as they say from psychology standpoint and the way it works
it's really kind of cool it's like this really neat thing although the psychological decisions they don't
really make a difference um they help you understand polarity because polarity is the first justifier
in the psychological map that comes thereafter the decision layers of human that humans make is
seen on the charts like you can you can read people's minds on the charts almost like you can you can read the charts and you can see into the mind of other
people and and how they made those decisions so it allows you to have a better insight to kind of watch this thank you a minute see what it does and
you'll you'll see where contracts exit you're closing your position I think a lot of people are going to because
you'll have those trigger points I think you can create trigger points here and trigger points are Trends but you can
create some of these uh like you could go like that and then you could go this one right here because that would be the
next one right to there and then you could say you know this one to here and now you're starting to talk about like
um it's something I haven't named or something I I know the theory and I know
the formula I just don't have a name for it we're just going to call it recycling for now it just recycles itself down into a moment where it breaks Trend and
then you have different moments of recycling that happened so it just ends up being this you know the the more that
these exterior layers compound interior Wise It's almost like angle of an airplane think of it like that like the
harder it goes nose down the harder it's crashing becomes the more you know the final moments before you can pull that
joystick back or pull the the the what do they call that the ball of the plane or the um not the roll not
the bow the Dow Dow the plane I think that's what it's called like before plane crashes you can go see nose dive
down as far as you can and then you can create that polarity based on you know other factors which that's more
Butterfly Effect too stuff but and finding tops and bottoms but then that's pretty cool
yeah why that's what it is yeah right am I right Pilot's in here do we have any Pilots I know we have pilots in the
community the Yao the Yao of the plane am I right I know it has a term is it the Yao
I'll apply to Google this airplane now pretty sure it's Yao
that's the pitch right but I'm probably so off let's move on
is it here anybody who's opening Lawns because they think this is
breaking yeah yes the other plane the up and yes the vertical motion not the the horizontal pitch not the
horizontal gotta continue horizontal pitch not the vertical if it breaks down horizontal breaks up you're gonna see
these people exiting so people who have shorted this level so so this a couple hundred Bitcoin that comes in here we'll
exit the trade here it's going to go through here and this is who's exiting that trade right
because this is like kind of the first moment before a Breakout
see what happens here over the next minute or so
a hard close we've got contracts exiting people are sitting there finger finger on the
trigger waiting and saying okay I entered how much x amount of Bitcoin here I better get the hell out of this move
so that's probably what you're seeing right now is contracts closing this is not like active positions opening this
is contracts closing this thing doesn't have enough contracts closed you'll have a new round of active
contracts coming to short this thing down so that's where you'll see a big dump happen
ah all of a sudden a hard close makes sense if there's not enough contracts or if there's not enough so all of a
sudden we have if justification for the Deep dive houses and why it works multiple times there's going to be
active shorts opening and vice versa
that's a tongue twister okay if there's not enough
shorts Longs will close if there's not enough Longs shorts will close there we go got it nailed it second try
I've been doing the video here see
you can just watch this for a minute see how it unfolds so I would expect if this hard closes here
you're going to see a large amount of shorts close
but if those shorts can't close you're going to have active shorts coming in more active shorts
these decisions are usually made in the last you know encompassing seconds because they're you know you've got people sitting here
waiting to close these shorts in case this thing moves up to take their profits so they're going to wait till like 55 56
57 before the 60 second Mark and then when that 60 second Mark comes in the first candle that opens you're going to
see like a couple seconds pass burp right because that's what happens another reason why this happens without
getting into it too much in this video um when I first made this the other reason why this happens is because
people who are hedging wanna imagine you're imagine you're hedging a position you want to hedge a
position that can confirm more information so if you're given the
option now you're talking about like a logical layer of think like a thinking layer
um theoretical layer something that can create data so what could you do what action could you take to create
data on the chart so if you were to hedge this when would you wait well you'd wait for the last second or two because your
hedge has the biggest spread between hard closing information x a few seconds before a few seconds after this is where
you can really also understand when you when you understand the psychological layer of Traders and active and passive
contracts you can say okay there's a four hour that's about to open if x happens or there's a four hour opened
that just happened because of why then you you take that and you say oh I'm going to hedge a trade what would be the
most logical way to do this well the most logical way to hedge a trade if you're closing a passive contract which
now you need to understand if it's passive or active to understand where points of polarity happen would be to create data on the charts so if you were
to create data on the charts you would do in the last few seconds or the first few seconds as those would be the
dictators of new information or old information about to create new information so now active and passive
contracts goes even a layer deeper as to when do active and passive contrast close so now you interject the variable
of time with active impact of contracts now there's a whole other umbrella of decisions that need to be made around the
um integer of time right so that that's important to know as well not that I not that I expect people in here to be like
oh passive contract closing in exactly four seconds if it does this x but this can also lead to understanding things
and the justification of when it happens almost have to be a super calculator to understand this stuff but it's a part of
the variable of decisions that get made is what can time what what is the effect of time it's why I talk about horizontal
and vertical axes in two different measurements in future of trading because the measurement of time has its own valuable
as its own integer that can be combined with things like hard closing that can be combined with things like passive
contracts is a passive and active contract the decision point right it's oh I have a contract I need to make a
decision a decision can have more impact if I combine it with the effect of time and then time has its own tree map right
so
what the hell I'm talking right now this isn't actually moving up unless it's gonna happen in the last few seconds but again
that's why we don't make these decisions until certain times right like I said the most you always wait
undervalued lesson in the entire Butterfly Effect is active and passive contracts because it represents something that's not discussed as much
or it's discussed without knowing and again I just have to always remember that layman's terms of of the people who are
watching at home versus how I see things and and the deeper layers like this this is exactly where you would need to learn
this stuff is in a mentorship session because it's you have to go through this stuff or at least we need to talk about it enough long to understand these
little hammer down different effects of the charts
if there's not enough shorts that close here tons of active
shorts will open
probably such a huge missing component for so many people in here this lesson
and of course we always need to look at the higher time frame see that's contracts closing because it hard closed
because everybody who entered here wants to lock and profit this moment right here it's like if
entered here wants to lock
here tons the effect of time 259 three minute
candle heart closes three minute level tested three minute level laddering and
create possibly and what's the timestamp where's the overall type I don't see it I wanted to see if
there's a coordination between also a 5 and a 15 minute um imagine passive contract imagine
you're in a trade short from here you know all that you know now that we talked about today you shorted this level perfect uh you got ideal entry you
you marked the right level you picked it you entered your trade but you've done your job what becomes a trigger point
where does your your information have the most value three minute chart is to what it looks like the three minute hold
level holding it here the reverse level holding it here right um or possibly backside I can't tell
without actually having the chart in front of me but I'm assuming it's backside here I'm assuming it's reverse backside hard close this three minute
level so this three minute level is now hard closed here and this hard closes the trend the effect of time with
passive contracts if you were there for in a passive contract doesn't this look like the perfect moment to exit the trade before it launches well you can't
you no longer can reject hard close your contract below so this just becomes a very simple trigger point on a passive
contract where you should just get out of your trade of active eight short two one
zero on track being filled probably whoever's trying to get out of the trade being filled
um Panic selling you see it in that little Wick Spike there right break over this is the final
ladder point is it gonna break it yes or no are we going to hard enough let's create a new three
that's contracts closing because they're hard closed so now you would have the justification to say hey I'm in a passive contract it makes sense to get
rid of this thing it makes sense to now leave this trade because my passive contract no longer has a value right here it has a diminishing value your
passive contract now has a diminishing valuable locking in profit edging a position means that if you're
in a long you turn it into a short a hedging a position means um
like this if you enter a short here you take that short you're in profits you take that short and you exit your short
here and also enter long you're hedging your position so you're activating two contracts at once so if you had like a
500 short here you'd enter a one thousand dollar long here you close this 500 which is a thousand five hundred of
this a thousand dollars and then you add you buy 500 more so so you you would enter like a long for a thousand dollars
right here that would be hedging a position so it's just double ending the position like selling your short to activating into a long otherwise it
would just be a 500 position here and you close the position there for 500 and then you you maybe you enter you know
later on in the in the test um you could also refer to that as hedging when you re-enter later on the whole level but you know the traditional
meaning of hedging is just Closing one contract directly into opening the other so a 500 short would turn into a
thousand dollar long contract right here all in one move it's not two separate 500 500. it is but it's combined into
one it's combined into one entering long while you were in the
short but you're still not sure you you are you're entering long from a short but it closes your short and opens it and along
like it's reversing your position you were shorting and then you want it to long one trade here one trade here short
and a short long that live together here
it was actually a three minute candle I didn't realize that that's why it hadn't happened so that one minute candle right
there opened up this service that was actually a three minute candle that closed that's
why it happened like that a little bit of a strong count I didn't realize I was on the three minute I thought I was on the one minute that's fine it's
one in the same here
and the closer this thing gets the uh more it's going to start you know shorts will start closing that's the way it
works just like magic being able to predict the future right and it's not it's just
a very actually Common Sense kind of kind of thinking it's just you know you have to deduce the
reasoning of why people are making these decisions right but you know then the
smart people know where targets are right so this was already tested so you'd be inside of this range somewhere so you would have already actually
exited off of the base of this range so you would have exited right here
I wonder if this trend was created in this moment so if you actually around this thing you'd be right here on one time frame
you break through that and you're going to try to hold this so yeah you would have exited somewhere in this range down
here you might not have gotten your perfect exit here but I could also be missing something
this inside of this candle here so whatever is next on this
yeah well that I mean that makes sense whatever's next it's right there so that's actually what exactly what it
would be that's where your target would be so so actually people who were on here so you
would have already actually exited notice how three minute level right here is holding the move it's not hard
closing the three minute level that's why the three minutes used on this side pretty sure that's why I'm zoomed into
the three minute for most of this trade because I probably noticed that uh three minute level here being tested three
minute level here holding it three minutes test three minutes hard close three minute break move off of the base
of this range so you would have exited right here I wonder if this trend was created in this moment so if you actually around
this thing you'd be right here or one time frame I would always use lemonade to lock up profits or Lewis I would never use it an
emergency situation down here you might not have gotten your perfect exit here but Arkansas is more of a
hedge um you can hedge a limit on Market or you can so whatever's next on this uh Market hedge but uh yeah I would always
do limit yeah well that I mean that makes sense always limit you should always have your your strategies
that's where your target would be so so actually people who were really good at this thing were already out anyways
because there's just no point to hold past this level right here there's just no point Market costs so much money to do Market
orders it costs such a higher percentage test the greediest point in the next one anyways yeah it's ridiculous
I just walk through the move at this point so it does move right through the 15 minutes so that's fine just watching remove at this point I remember the rest
of this just doesn't make sense because there's too much risk associated with opening any position here short or long regardless of what
so we went through a bit of a brain melt today I gave you guys um something a butterfly effect that you've never seen before I I gave uh
part a part of the the reasons that I can't talk about butterflies like the things that I'm not
allowed to talk about because it's just too advanced for um a butterfly effect lesson right like it's just literally
too advanced so we definitely went through a pretty crazy lesson today um more Theory driven more of a somber
tone today less excitement less technical technically driven but but more of a theory there where it allows
you to see deeper meta information on the charts which of course is way better than technical anyways because now
you're getting the reasons as to why things happen which allows you to have a better grasp and a better foresight on on exactly what's going on in these
charts so um I definitely under appreciated these videos before yeah
well it's not it's not by design my own design to make it less and it's not by
the fault of you it's just the way in which uh unfortunately I have to teach things and there's there's two parts of
being a teacher like I can't expect people as a first go about in future of trading and Butterfly Effect and any of these things
to start talking about deep set theory like this and and the you know formulas and the reason why people will just tune
out they already tuned out because the material is too tough as it is even future of trading for most is too tough and it's why I have such low subscribers
but but then to to further push that factor of difficulty would
just not make sense so it's not not by anybody's design or fault but um but just the to the benefit of mentorship is
is where you can get that deeper understanding and uh the value of active and passive contracts can cannot be overlooked because this is you're
literally talking about the first parts of chart architecture passive and active you're talking about the uh
the Unseen layer as where something could potentially happen it's like the Unseen variable it's it's variable X
right it's that it's that variable that can control it all it's the starting point for it all and it's why it's kind
of segmented into chapter two because instead of teaching it like this deep set theory
um at least I can break up butterfly effect into chapters of understanding where one day at a time becomes oh awesome now I can apply it that's often
why people if you think about it that's often why people gravitate towards one day at a time so many many of you
actually in here have said one day at a time is your favorite lesson because it's the simplest part of butterfly effect that actually makes you feel
valuable it's the simplest part of the entire course that makes you feel like you're not stupid that's why everybody
loves it so much because it's it's kind of the lesson that everybody can really resonate with because it is kind of
dumbed down and again not by the fault of anybody or the design of of the material on on purpose it's designed
like this because there's only one way in which it can properly be taught to really put people down down a path of of
the highest amount of success because it's already abysmal learning Butterfly Effect it's already abysmal and I
realize that before I even put it out it's just like yeah I expect people to be able to keep
up with this sure dude so it's already kind of like you know um
but hey that's why mentorship is so good because we talk about stuff like this and uh yeah this is this is like
critical um you guys won't understand it in one pass about because it is such deep
theory that you know you work together use the butterfly effect channel to start talking about act as passives it
might feel weird it might feel un not not unnormal might be might feel odd it might feel out of place because you're
so used to using hold levels and break levels but this is this is the layer where of day trading where you
call it the cotton Factor call it whatever you want this is that deeper layer that allows you to dig and find
and find the real information that not that the whole levels aren't real but there's always something before a whole double there's always something before a
ladder Point there's always some kind of Secret Sauce in there but this is this is really the beginning of that path for you guys so having in theory today but
also um a valuable and end game a most valuable piece you guys have probably gotten so far
okay guys uh cheers thanks for stopping by today and we'll see you on the stream in like half an hour or something all
right bye
okay let's uh let's get to it here let's hear let's music and I'm going to start right now
I would I would kind of be
when I told you just to move that level that's great but you miss what's actually happening so so what you should
like your stuff perfect so it's not weird no that's why I don't tell you guys
because on a higher time frame it hasn't developed yet so hopefully everybody was able to look
at ranges yesterday we're going to be really diving in into them today and how to define them that's what today's all about is
defining the ranges because this is a big part of the queue of information as you need to go forward is you have to define the
range properly first before you start working on a range if you're if you're working on an inaccurate range like you
might as well be like putting water in a gas tank it's not like nothing's gonna work this is
it's like it might make a few noises but it's not going to work so it like it's critical to understand how we Define
ranges and the starting points of a range because range range work goes very deep there's going to be other lessons
in butterfly effect on ranges as well but as a starting point we need to understand how we perfectly identify a
range so that's what this is all about and hopefully everybody was able to get some of those exercises and take some
practice if not we're going to do it together today anyway so but we do want to see those moments so right now what
this shows me is greediest level entry possibly back test this stay above the
break this is fine because you see if we if we adapt it too much we kind of Miss what's
happening if you adapt it you look for a moment in the future by de-evolving it like this
you understand what's happening in the present so it's like analyzing the present versus the future but so so by
having that Trend here we can see what will happen in the future like how how I move through those trends like what I don't tell people is I'm moving them
back and forth a lot so that's not something I've ever gotten into with anybody yeah but it's analyzing what can happen in the future versus what's
happening in the present because you'll miss like you could actually then would it be more helpful to draw
the two of them um a class and present past and future it
can be you can you can do it like that for sure because really right now what are we we're seeing this whole levels being hit
it hasn't back tested this trend yet I don't know if it needs to I suppose that would be the moment where it's like okay
um if we distribute and and break this trend okay so something really important to
talk about is everything we do we need to constantly be defining ranges so it
is it is critical to take your information and Define a range
like that this is a larger range living inside of a smaller range I think I think that's pretty obvious at this point you know you've got a smaller
range that's developed off of uh the attack of this whole level this whole level is obviously going and um
continuing to support the move but it's also developing its own small interior range and uh understanding how we have
ladder points and all the points that break a chart is is a lot of range work so just
important to realize right now that this is kind of I would just call this like a micro range something that's only relevant until it's broken like this is
going to be a range that's in play for maybe I don't know three four hours maybe if it's um moving really fast it
may only be in play for 20 30 minutes there's every every time you have a break like this right here where you
break up into a new section you need to create micro ranges because those micro ranges will show you where it's breaking
into next it's like the pieces inside of a Pandora's Box which I think everybody gets but it's just important to
reiterate that sometimes we work with ranges in in different ways sometimes we
have large ranges that stay on our screen for weeks on end months on end maybe only a day or two but sometimes we
have ranges that are only active for 30 minutes but defining it as a range is important because it gives you your
parameters of what's going to move it up or down so that's where we're going to start defining today building out that
understanding and that criteria set right we pull back to
even possibly here no
followed by no I'm just looking right here you can go back to this moment right here
oh sorry don't move your chart yeah I'll just leave it alone you could pull back to this moment here if you lose that
trend and still be moving up and still be okay yeah there's a lot of things we're
analyzing on these cam on these charts that yeah where could the latter point be because
you know even here you do have this this this so technically as long as
you stay above this one you're still laddering so then you look for the level that's staying above that right so then you would say like okay well this level
right here is technically above that so so you could technically still be laddering if
you lose the current trend you see what I mean so so people will be shorting into this and then they might get liquidated on the long before the
short yeah yeah there's there's so many different things going on on this chart
right now and it's you know you miss one of them
and buying you're gone especially on the big Leverage yep absolutely
it's understanding I can remember you I can remember writing down the you know a trend can fan out and it's still not
failure absolutely and that's simply because it's laddering like we could go and hit this level and uh technically it
just laddered off of this creating a point out here like if it comes out here and hits that and then and then it just creates a trend that we need to break in
the future which means this isn't going to hold it this attack on these levels is happening now if whatever level we
attack here is the final level in all of this that's attacked so we are looking for the final moment right
okay looks like our trend is uh working nicely yeah it is actually yeah it's holding
so you know when you see and I've seen it so many times uh you get like it
takes off and you get one percent in one minute candle yeah what is that
polarity right but you could call this trend break here a moment of polarity it's
either gonna break it or not right it's risky I would say this is not a Moment of
clarity 7276 like 7276 is your moment here so there are there are levels of
polarity levels or levels of polarity strength if you like yep yeah yeah you have to pick the
strongest one um yep
but there's a new short to be had here it says uh
I don't even know the level anymore it was a it was this yellow one it's
sorry just gray one 72 79 727 yes
foreign I don't think the short is over I just think we're going after a greedier moment here
okay really it's our job to um it's it's our job to um
find the greediest in this rejection because it does look like rejection now now it won't be rejection if it goes
over top of this level it won't be a rejection if it starts holding over that but that's going to be our best entry if
it is rejection yes do you remember saying to us a couple weeks ago too about if it meanders its
way up towards the level there's a chance to shoot on fruit yeah yeah absolutely and and that's you know and
right here it's going to try to hold whatever it's holding like as long as it can hold over top of this it's fine as
long as it holds over top of that you know which makes this whole level so what would be important right now
um you guys are looking at this chart what would be important to change on this chart right now let's do a little pop quiz here
day you're in a long from right here let's put let's put it this way say you just took a long down right here I don't know what price this is but this looks
like about 7 200 or so say you took a long from 7200 right here what do you
need to do on this chart now that you've broken over this trend what do you need to do the trend
nope hold the level of hard closed nope well those are important things to hold
the whole levels on heart because you just got to keep laddering right the higher time frames and Trends nope
gotta look lower lower is that a shield on the whole level that would be also important like these are
all good things to do these are all I would consider these good practice but right now within this range what you'd
want to do is you'd want to start treating this as if it were like Pretend We're not on the one minute pretend these are four hour candles treat this
the same as you would that because they're all data points communicating the same thing and I think people will realize this or already do realize this
but sometimes we just need a reminder that these are all just data points communicating different
parts of the chart so so like imagine these are four hour candles you need to have a local Trend here even to understand what this range is going to
do even if this is a micro range to better understand what this is going to do even like right now let's do it right
now okay sure you're uh you're inside of a move right now right okay you've uh just just broken up this move right here
okay good perfect today uh this is disease look at this this is great we just we just we just broke up and uh you
know you need to start adding Trends and this can be a range here this is a range here so if you wanted to short you would need to
you know what we'll take this to the middle of the screen and we'll replay this right here if you are in a
short you would even go back to here and uh you would you would even just sorry if you wanted to short I need to
clarify that if you wanted to short say you shorted this candle right here you're like oh my God I got perfect entry 60 2090 yeah yeah good perfect
right on 62 090. uh this is amazing and you have your Trend here and uh your
first thing to do is like this okay I've got a trend here I need to uh break out of this right even this is too short you
this might be just quite short as well this is only a few minutes but uh you know you break past that and you need to
see where the pullback happens and you need to be adapting these Trends to say okay oh I'm losing money okay we break over
this I need to get out of my shirt so so even locally you have to constantly be creating these because at this point you should be
out because this thing's about to break up you're about to Heart close the trend and this should be like the red flag right here it should be oh I'm in short
at 62 000.93 even even as interior as this is and you could even do it
from here would be uh slightly more accurate from here right here like this because it's sort of been the first
Trend and uh this is the first Trend that's created and then it doesn't hard close until this point and that's the
hard close on the actual Trend so I mismarked that because it actually has to be the first part of the move your Trend and and the way you know that this
is correct is because if you were to rewind this in time okay if you were to run this in time you would say oh I actually have a
trend does it ever hard close doesn't hard close okay this is how you
know this is your Trend this is how you know where your correct trend is so whenever first off whenever you create a
range you need to find obviously this was the break from prior right this is obviously the break right
here you've got your whole level that's protecting the leg very straightforward whole level protects the leg breaks over the range creates another micro Ridge so
if this is going to dump it has to stay under this trend very straightforward very simple goes to its next range I'm assuming this is somewhere backside here
or front side here let's just go to the level ah perfect it's actually the levels being tested
um yeah you pretty much could have almost guaranteed yourself greedy entry here you use 62 100 even you would be at
like 62 000 and I don't know 94.50 and said 94.50 did this hit 680
94.50 97 51 perfect you're in your trade great your your order got filled but
actually your Trend exists here not there so so that's your first move up and you could as a pseudo Trend also
just as an extra layer of protection do this until you get better with Trends so you you could have both but really you would need this one here so when you're
in these moves even if they're micro Trends if you were to take a short here this would be your Shield this trend not
I mean the whole level cannot is your Shield too like okay there's more shorts here but this is more of a shield to
entering short here so this is your enter short Shield here because the last thing you want to do is you take a short here and you're like oh yeah that's good
and uh we want to minimize risks you see this is why it's so important to get great entries it's only nine percent but
that nine percent makes a difference the nine percent makes a difference because it might only be nine percent now but in a future trade it's going to be 24 and
I'm speaking with 100x here so 0.09 I'm speaking just in 100x terms um it might only be nine percent right
now but in the future it's going to be 24 25 like these gaps are a lot bigger so if you were going to add a shield to
this trade it would be this right here so if you enter short on the hold the first hold which is here or here that
would be your Shield you hard close over this you get out right and you're getting out at negative profits if you're entering here you're using the
trend right you you don't have that flexibility like you would be out here before the
move is broken if you were right here and you might still be in distribution so so this is something to be aware of is that this move could fail down and go
into distribution but if you entered on the whole level your Shield has to be that whole level as well right like it can't be the final point of the move you
could ladder point it here but then you're taking that risk for no reason right but hard closing the trend when you get
perfect entry hard closing your trend is is your is your kind of like your your magical gamut
like right there your heart calls a trend this thing's probably boosting now yeah just like what a one candle Ripper
and it's like okay well good luck getting out now because you just you know there's a liquidation a little one
candle Ripper right so then either there's sometimes it's really thin where we find these spots where we can exit
and this is why defining a range and understanding ranges is so critical because it gives us kind of
almost like a time bomb it's like you're constantly playing a game of Search and Destroy racing against the clock against
the charts like there's always one final moment where you have like kill three guys and Defuse The Bomb you
got five seconds left go right like that's kind of the same mentality here it's like in for people who don't
understand that means it's like a CS go thing but um what that means is you're always given like a few critical moments
where you're able to see Escape can happen where you're able to see where you can still save your trade on on good
or bad and understanding ranges as a part of that as you moves in crypto are violent so that
would be like one spot to do it here would be another spot oh pause pause that's great and then so you have like another range here and you have to
develop these ranges so you'd be here in this case you'd be here because the move wasn't done the difference between
marking this first candle versus the second candle is you have to wait till
the move is done at this point this pulls back creates a distribution candle allows it to create a trend that's why
you would not use this candle in this instance because the trend is being created from here because it's still moving up
unless it's justifiable on a different time frame you've laddered off this which your range now you have to let's
delete this because we don't need this and let's work on the bottom of this as if we were trading this because this is kind of like scalpers mentality that
we're getting into now okay so you got a three minute here so you could start with this right here like this to this this is not accurate yet we need to find
the distribution candle that actually makes sense we don't have anything there we do we have anything on the 15 probably not no we don't have anything
on the 15 so we go back to the one minute and we do this distribution distribution it's all we have so you've
got this right here which is kind of testing whatever's holding it here so this is testing a ladder point which can
give you like a micro range Trend also can have this as a whole level this is a hold level this is a trend hit this
whole level start closing under this trend you may end up indeed going and using this as a three minute base is there a five minute base here so we need
to re-pin this to the three there's a five minute let's repin it to the fire I know there's no 15. we already checked no need to look okay let's look no need
to look five minute pin go to down in time frames I worked the wrong way from one minute up to show you guys what I
would do but in in a you know this for example but in real scenario I would go
time frame down I would have started 15 I know there's not going to be a one hour there it's one minute candles 15 nothing five pin first just move it to
the second candle so I can put it on my screen nothing on the three we've got something on the one so we've got a trend range Trend okay good
this is what we need to do on all trades old level hard close loses the move see
but that's critical to know now we're working in a different Trend so that was
the thing about this move is where you would see that it's not going to hold this level that's why this doesn't hold so a lot of
times people be like oh why did the whole level hold it lost its Trend that's why the trend is controlling the range now you quite possibly have
something you actually don't you're going to be even lower here so let's just go back to the one I was gonna I was thinking you
might have trend from here to here on a five minute time frame but there was no five minute there
see you lose the range that's why so that's critical to understand this range up here is being lost here whole level
can't hold it how can it look at where it's hitting a whole double it's hard in order to hit this hold level there's
your like one minute of like get the H out because if you entered on this whole level you could enter this whole level
that's fine I don't mind that but you have like you're in you stay in the trade for about 30 seconds and you
get out equal you're not waiting because you can see that this thing's not moving up and it's actually hard closing the trend so maybe in this moment in in the
opening couple seconds of this candle you have an open trade
here fine it goes straight down it hits you're in a trade you're sitting there you see price isn't moving up you're
like oh God we're about to hard close other trend this level's not going to bounce it's son of a b because otherwise you would
expect to do like this like if you actually hit this whole level and start moving up you'd expect to create this as your your range Trend right and it's
actually going to move up and break the range but in this moment it's like oh we're in the trade it's like maybe 10 seconds left in this candle and it's
like oh we're not moving up we're actually going to close in distribution and then so you do and and so so what
happens is you get exactly what you do for not paying attention you get you get you Inked right and I'm not going to
work on on this stuff down here but uh this is really really important to know for maybe we could do it in an hourly's
a little thin what about the four nothing on the four this is way too early so the hourly you could have
this to this which breaks there which could possibly create this there so then you're working time frame down right you
already have it you have the 15 there which is you leave the hourly there
with this 15 to this heart close here actually you know no it's the same thing why am I doing that we could just move this
let me just move this to here and and there's your range right like there's the range for the larger piece now instead of working from
this as your first range you're now working from this as a larger range and
then when this breaks if the level can't hold it because you're going to have your level which look your level's
already tested right so you have to ladder above this so you're going to come out to a moment where it's like oh Trend uh hopefully you hold it off a
ladder point but if you don't and you start hard closing guess what trains you're going to you're going to your next range right so that's pretty
important to know with ranges is we Define them constantly and we're just going to hit play here and kind of see how this thing works out see how it hits
Trend it's holding its range right and now this right here come on should actually be
like this right here so this would have actually been like this so now you're working inside of this range so you can
see how it's kind of constantly holding that range we can delete all this other noise it's not important
so this is about defining how ranges get created and how they start and where they are and then we can just kind of
walk through this and you'll see oh we're in it right now oh perfect cool we can see how this evolves today and you
can see you're holding your range and this is where you get the evolution of ranges as if you were to start from now
we started backwards I I worked from the most I shouldn't say the most small that's not good English I worked from
the smallest time frame backwards which in reality you should be working the other way but just to show you guys for
this replay right here what what Pat should have done here is he should have taken a trend right here and he should
have had one that goes like that so somebody said adapt the range uh Jen's I think it was let me look yeah Jen's Jen
said adapter so you should have went from here to here that breaks it creates the next accumulation cycle piece so from here
here and then that needs to break so adapting Trend was kind of like a soft right answer it was the wrong
answer because he's thinking I think Jen's meant to adapt these Trends but in reality you need to define the interior range right so you need to Define that
range to understand what's happening and where your levels that can actually hold this thing exist because then you can start
marking the actual untested levels under ranges that can still be above the
current range like for example this right here oh come on dude this right here is a whole level that's
untested could this create a range here yes it could it could actually create a range like this right so that's critical
to know and what's this based off of the hourly aha you got the hourly here so that could create a range and that's
important because you actually have this here tested there this year and and you can go through
this queue of seeing what's capable and what's not capable to being being an actual range here but that's like
critical when you're defining ranges you have to find those points on your
trends that are controlling the trade like that's how you can see this one right here like it's it's the first piece it doesn't matter about tying it
to the highest candles you don't you don't go like this this is not the way we use Trends you tie it to the appropriate candle to define the range
and that's where you get this and then when you card close here if your Trend was like this all of a sudden you hard closed here and
you boost past this trend and you're like well why didn't Trend respect well because you had the wrong Trend it's as simple as that you weren't using the trend properly Trends are and the reason
why this works the way they are from like a point of data or or point of information is if a trend is created
here it needs to hard close on the time frame it create it's created on in order
right so it can't be an hourly you can see that it can't be an hourly so it's the next time frame could it be a four
uh maybe in the future it can be a four so if we linger around here for long enough then we can go and make this a
four and then maybe even if it stays longer we can make it a daily but there's no four hour yet there and there's no one hour yet there but
there's could be a one hour like this so what if this was a range okay well this this actually okay the CC it can't be it
can't be arranged because this is accumulation distribution could it be four let's see
no it can't be four uh could it be 15. and so you'd have this to this at first
which would be like this this come on dude
aha you see now you could stop here in the future so the time frame to time
frame right if you create it on the 15 break it on the 15 and if you can't be created don't use it if if you have to
use a higher pinpoint to say this was a blue candle fine you use 15 minute here and you go down and you find the next
point oh here's here's a white to white candle or beige to beige yellow whatever color you want to call this then that's
fine the bases on the 15 the pinpoint is on the five and then we have to use what the pinpoint is to break the move so we
can't go back to the 15 and break the 15 on this five Trend we actually have to
use the five minute to five minute time frame so like this breaks here hard close moves up there perfect good follow
the cue so far breaks up here moves up there good hard close to here breaks up there moves up there good we cannot go
on the 15 and use this trend now we have to use it time forward from the reach point the reach point of the trend
controls it the base point is where it gets created for accuracy the reach point is what
controls it so I'm going to write that in chat base creates
base creates reach controls
these creates reach controls and I'm going to pin this
base of the move creates a trend the reach controls and the reach is the time frame that you've seen it on like for
example here on the on the 15 until you can go up in that time frame and say oh actually we don't need to use the five
because the 15 is here because you'll get a false reading if you were to go like this and say oh let's pin it to the five and and you just set it and forget
it because in that moment maybe it was still blue but it wasn't blue on the five and then you created it then you
just hit your play button and you're like okay that's good now the five minute can hard close and break it well so that's where you'd get a wrong reading that's where you'd get a
misreading saying like oh how come the five minute hard closed it there's a five minute hard closer how come this is
breaking the move well it's actually in fact that you didn't go in and pin it to the appropriate time frame you pinned it
and you never went back to look again to see if it actually created the 15 because then you have to go like this you have to swing it and re-pin it you
can't just leave it make sure you swing it and repin it because when you pin it to the five it's going to give you a
different reading than when you pin it on the 15 it might only be off a like a slight degree but that slight degree
trust me it makes a difference when you're talking but hard closing the corner of the bottom side of a candle so now we need to break on the 15 because
we've created this on the 15 does it have an hourly it doesn't so there's no hourly Trend here there's no hourly hard closes that we need there's nothing to
do on the hourly it's just a 15 to the 15 which we thought was the five but prematurely we
marked that in the moment because it was like okay there's a 15 to a 5 here good for now but maybe in 15 minutes we need
to recheck to see if it creates a 15. we know it can't be an hourly because the hourly top isn't there so we can never use the hourly we never go 15 back a
time frame up we always work time frame down this is marbles dropping through circles so you've got a table here and
there's a circle right Circle here right marbles can only
travel one way oh sorry like this it hits it rolls it rolls marbles can't go
up in time frames it's just think of it like that and the marbles dropping through holes on a table can only go down time frames you can't
you can't send a marble up the queue you can't go from this Middle Point and send it up the queue it can only move down
so that should clear up a lot of people's questions about trends to find the pinpoint of the trend
do we also use the top of the first move because I'm always doing a lot of work find hard clothes after hard close
um I don't know if I understand this I find the pinpoint of the trend
pop of the first move yes unless it hard closes
unless the range isn't done like say you break this and move up slightly here
and you fall like this you're still using this because it's underneath this ladder if you break up over this and you
fall like that and you go like this like in our first example you're using whatever this is to that like that
you're not using you're using where the trend is first creating the range just like we did on that first example
we did that for these one minute candles down here remember
God I think it was this right I don't remember where it was
it this one I think it was this right here you're
using the first spot you create the move like these are the
tops of the candles but they're not what's controlling it this was actually this broke the range and this created
your first Trend so you have to think of it like this is it creating a trend yes
is it hard closing to create a new trend because if this heart closed up then we'd move this but in this moment it's
not creating a new trend it's just creating this as a trend and and given that this is only one minute candles you're gonna expect a pretty big
move on either side here when this happens yeah there's finally a hard close here
like at this point you wouldn't be like this you you wouldn't be from here to here because you don't have a hard close
from here to here you just have a straight rip through so you don't have a hard close there but actually you do
have a hard close you just missed it so where the trend gets created if it hasn't if this trend isn't broken this
is still an active Trend so that would be the way to think about it like this is an active Trend or like the weekly
Top is an example yes exactly the weekly Top is an example we use this to this as our Trend and you notice
how it hasn't broken yet that's another example right if if the trend gets created and it hasn't hard closed it's
still in play I think this lesson is going to clear up a lot of range work and trends for
people like a lot I think this is this Sunday lesson here today we're about to do is like kind of it's already slam dunking it
okay let's continue we'll still do so that was that was that was Pat's problem here like that's what I wanted to see from Pat I wanted to see him even put
some just interior Trends here just like some interior trends like you see how on on the screen right now you would have
had this to this and this hard closes breaks the reason why you would use this
top candle and not this one now is because it met two criterias it hard closed the trend that was first created
right like at first it would have technically been this one right here to that one right there so it would have
been that one to that one like that like this like angle like this right um this candle couldn't have recreated Trend so it can still dump down and this
can still be Trend so it could still go straight down and this can still be Trend but because this one hard closes with a wick over top of this now trend
is here like that right now trend is like that this one then hard closed over top
of this trend as a higher point so this is the trend that's being used now like this like that like this and that's what
Pat needed to do he needed to have a local piece to see if this was actually going to break its move or not because the trend will work with the hold levels
to break the moves right yeah but again it could simply come all
the way down into this range down here or even lower before attacking this level it could come down all the way
down to the front side hold down here right like all the way down here it's all apart like we can only ever see
one piece in the future like what I told you guys before we can only ever see one piece into the future we can't we can't
see two moves because we have to see what's developing first to see what's developing next but we can always see the next part of the move like we can
always say oh if this trend breaks we're gonna move up you know which gives us Clarity on on every trade we do because
that gives us the moments where we should either be entering or exiting right yeah no need to know what's happening two moments in the future even
if we didn't know what's happening then we don't need to know that because that's not going to help us right now yes yeah yeah I know what's happening I
mean every single tech there are human beings may have taken decisions yep we
don't I already know it's going to go down to 5300 so it's just about finding the right short to get us there so I already know what's happening two three
four five moves ahead in the future it's going to either go to 62. I believe that next one is 66 or 53. so
we already know what's going to short it's just finding the right right short here right so yeah even if even if even if we do know
what's happening two moves in the future that doesn't really help us in this moment because we still need to know this moment What's Happening you know so
if we get if we get a successful shot at 72-70 and it does it start its way down
while it's on its way down that's kind of like a position trade or swing trade you your your day trading all the way as
well grinding as you say yep yeah just a few different two different two different sets of Trades yeah
yeah so we've touched backside of that first Trend yeah
broke over its Trend and now hit the backside technically still laddering your ladder now is from here
so right you had this ladder here like this and then this one here like this
which is now giving you your next ladder point I'll attach it to it right there so long as we stay over over that kind
of thing now we're good
yeah right like as long as we stay over over this moment here we're fine so as long as we stay over this we're fine so the greediest point over that would have
been backside of trend actually that would have been the perfect moment yeah I'm sorry yeah
I'm just gonna keep watching this thing for a few minutes I think this is highly valuable what we're doing today I think you know I'm learning I'm learning tons
here listening to you it's great I mean I don't know if this was your objective for this session not really but it's a
perfect moment right it's just kind of one of those improvisional things it's kind of like the perfect moment to um look at a trait because it's happening
right in front of our house so imagine still being in this trade from like 70 to 30 as Pat was in that short and not
having any control over this trade like I think this is something that as people get better they realize being
in trades is all about the control that you have it's not about getting good entry well of course it's about getting
good entry because that gives you control but it's not about these ultimately the focus and everybody's
mind when they're trading should be how do I have more control that should be if
there was a manual I would call it day trading how to have more control if I was to make a book how to have more
control because that's what it's about it's about having more control in your trades more spots where you can safely enter and exit more awareness more
foresight to moves it's all about control so range work gives us that
amazing control where we can be in a trade and we can say like oh I know I need to get out if x happens like this
this little Trend example we did here like this is perfect control if it hard closes we have our rule if we don't get
out we're just being egotistical at that point we're just thinking we know better than the data
points are actually telling us for some reason we think that the data points are wrong and all of a sudden we're right how that's a question I post to people
how often do you see my science work it works like 99 of the time when used properly that it's impeccable the
accuracy is like unfathomable how insane it is so the only time mistakes happen
is when ego gets in the way so if you think that all of the sudden here in
this trade you've marked your Trends properly your levels everything is good if you think all of a sudden hey
I know this is dumping I just know it in my heart well I'm happy for you that you know it in your heart uh yo you're still
right technically you're right here it's dumping you're good you're good man all of a sudden the rule is broken you
should just get out this should be as neutral as possible there's no emotion there's no ego there's no I know it in my heart there's nothing other than a
data point that describes to you what's about to happen next and if you ignore it then you will lose money so this is
all about having ultimate control so when you can use range working levels and all these things properly
it's simply just about what the data point is telling you and it's like oh I know in my heart well
I'm happy for you you're about to have a miserable Christmas on a black heart because you just you know lost it all and this is where
people have a lot of problems in trading is that they try to they try to have this measurement of
intuition this measurement of it's like it's not like playing slot machines this
isn't a measurement of intuition I just know I've seen this before yes of course we have this layer of intuition that can
describe to us something else that we may not see subconsciously but that subconscious cue and Trigger is still on
set by data so it is still onset by okay subconsciously I have this intuition
factor that I just know it's moving up or down but this may be this may still be true that you have an
intuition factor and your intuition is sometimes right but the thing is is your intuition is reading the correct data so
your intuition is doing something that you're not doing so if you were to say have this trend here like this oh boy
the wrong one if you were to have this trend here and all of a sudden your intuition was like I gotta get out of my
short man I know this thing is going to pump it's it's my intuition I've seen this before
you have seen this before but subconsciously this is what you see this is what happens subconsciously this is
what you have so this is how intuition looks like in training this is what your subconscious mind is seeing and this is
what you're actually seeing on your screen and and and the thickness and the you you have this gray dotted line and
you're like I know this is correct and I've seen this before I know this is about to pump it's my intuition
yeah your subconscious intuition is looking at this this doesn't exist even though you marked it your your intuition you're getting that feeling because your
brain is saying wait you're not picking it up man like trust me I've seen this before you're doing the wrong Trend dude
man trust me like look the ladders here you're not marking that the trend is there you may have your
little great dotted line that's incorrect and you have your intuition and this is where people have a problem because they they do they don't they
they ignore this and then they get emotion and this happens and then they're like it's still gonna dump look
at this triple top it's about to dump yoink see ya and then they go to a higher time frame and say it must have been something that I missed
and then they let that intuition and that emotion drive them into this point of Madness where really it was indeed
intuition but this is why this the dark this thick green line is why it was intuition so
control it's all about control controlling how you get the least amount of losses to a point that's so pulled
back to its origin state that you actually just have a set of raw data that's telling you exactly what to and
what not to do emotional struggle we all went through at first yep neutrality it's so key it
sounds easy but it's hard to have that self-control it's hard because you guys learn and and
there's no way to subdue this I've thought about this before it's hard because you guys learn incomplete
methods in a trickle fed kind of way it's hard because you learn oh here's a heart close here's a cycle here's this I
teach you guys pieces and steps so it's not by Design and it's not by fault that
you have to learn like this it's just by the raw process of this industry is so
much in in its like Alpha state so far still it's it's such an early state of
day trading we are so we we have got hundreds of years of manual day trading left if it ever even changes it's in
such a cave-like state caveman-like state day trading right now that there's so much
garbage that we have to get to and even through my courses as good as they are you still have to learn incomplete
pieces until you're in mentorship until you're at the end until you're learning Butterfly Effect too you're still learning in complete pieces you're just
getting more pieces of that puzzle filled in so it's not by Design it's not by fault it's not by the ability to like
imagine teaching this stuff backwards imagine taking a brand new Trader and then teaching them range work on hold levels they'd be like huh okay man
sounds good bye right that there's no there's no winning circle there there's
no complete circle that makes more sense as a starting point other than to have to go through a grind and have to
relearn and have to have the mental fortitude to understand the better techniques because you guys are using incomplete techniques until
you can learn it but you can't learn it without having those incomplete pieces first it's just the way the brain works right we can't we're not a computer
where you upload the entire manual the click of a button and it goes from zero to complete it's page by Page by Page by
Page like really the the great thing about today is you learned range is very in
depth like I don't think I've gone through ranges with anybody like this yet so this is like in-depth ranges
yeah so so this is actually something I hadn't completely you know unplanned but to learn ranges at this level that's why
mentorship is so valuable because it really clears up absolutely everything where you're at anyways because you're
400 profit on the week right but we know that you probably could have
been at six or seven or eight hundred percent and again no there's nothing wrong with 400 that that's fantastic
I left I left loads of money at the table on every trade absolutely but now
you are able to see like where that happens right so you have 400 profits in one week so so like you're you know
you're doing mentorship you've got all this hard work to get to this point and now you're like holy crap man I just
made 400 this week and this is great but now we can say okay that's good let's just step it up
and now where you entered earlier at 72 30 you see where that was fundamentally
flawed because you didn't Define the range so 7230 was great again you still
made profits but this is the difference between entering at 7230 versus 72.65 because this was an extra 35 on 70
points this is an extra 50 in this trade you you didn't make right for sure and I I've done that in every one of those
trades this week without a doubt so yeah this this is like a fantastic oh oh wow
okay well there's some distribution Jesus completely just broke its range
rate here so this is kind of a key moment right like you can even see like how right now we're analyzing this range and saying oh shoot like it just
okay now now we're down in this here now we're at that same point like okay we're allowed him here here I guess technically as long as we stay over this
we can develop the next piece of the ladder so actually if we went back to it we marked this level earlier
it was it was either this one or this one either one of these is fine like you'd have that there you'd have this
here they're all laddering the move that's the thing they're all still laddering off of this point
so as long as you stay over this so find that find the levels over top of this and technically you are still laddering
so we're still okay we haven't taken any second or third trades yet because really we're looking for that moment up
here but at least we have a clear path of you know yeah and you would you I mean just
what's what's common in front of my mind here right now that you wouldn't be long in these levels
because again in the middle of a bigger range what I would do is I'd move to a
higher time frame here now that we have more candles developed I would move to like a five minute chart here and see what the story is
because we've done we kind of seen the three minute and and so you do have that okay so like this you do have
this guy to this guy here which is actually our
first swing High to here so you have your first kind of you have your first kind of defined five minute candle you
like like this you have your first your first start of a cycle at the five
minutes you actually would have had this here which actually makes it this middle candle here so it's actually that middle candle
is the uh correct candle so I would Mark that Trend and and what I would do here is wait which Trend did I say 15 minutes
to make sure that I went through that pretty fast I actually would have had this yeah that's correct yeah that's correct
that's correct middle candle here so it's actually that middle candle is the uh could have been a higher time frame here but I may not
uh I'm made out of just ripping through the example that highest candle isn't
where we should actually the guys and guys I would Mark that one too yeah um
yeah oh no sorry go ahead and Mark that see we did miss something here look right here
see just not going through the time frame we just didn't do the work but this this is clearly the greediest ladder point we actually did miss this
this is where it was supposed to go but again we we didn't we didn't catch that because we were in the different time
frames you see how you do have to go through time frames as this evolves it's just something we didn't we didn't do for whatever reason so now I would go to
the 15 minute and see do we have any two accumulation counts we do so I would Mark those as well yeah exactly I see
that's kind of what we just went through the exact same uh yeah I hate how Pat
used that Trend that went from the left to the right it always made me so like and then I would go back it always
distracted me like I was trying to see something that I would look at it and my brain would just kind of go into this
Whirlwind just kind of floats off into space like why is that Trend there and then I always remember oh yeah Pat has
his extension left on first because that's the elongated Trend yeah extension left earlier signs yeah it
always confuses me it's not a big deal I'm just I'm really
I have the right level you guys haven't noticed I'm uh I'm really key to detail everything has to line up
perfectly I don't know if this is like a how deep my OCD is but everything has to
just have like the exact explanation to like the the smallest like it has to be
described perfectly it has to be centimeter to centimeter it has to fit like if I was like a tile installer if I
would like knock out a shower over one tile being slightly crooked I would like it would drive me nuts I would lose sleep it's just how I am so
yes everybody refresh good good call refresh um
a bit of a picture straightener yeah yeah trust me it's that's bad okay let's take a small break here I'm gonna get a
drink [Music] I think once people get this this range
work done I think it's gonna clear up a lot of different stuff that's happening for people on the charts
you don't understand why yesterday from today let's make sure we're talking about the right one first
um because I don't want to beat marking looking at the wrong thing so we're we're talking about you're talking about this big green Trend that I have right
you're talking about this one here correct [Music]
yes this one okay so this is the top of the move
it can't be this because you have a daily break over and there's also a higher time frame so
there's also a higher time frame here right you've got the top of a move which is why you have this right here so
hopefully that's not confusing in any way otherwise you would be having
the very bottom of this move here right like then your Trend would be here and you'd have no Trend work you'd have no
active Trend work on your screen so if you're using month to month to month
wait oops you're using month month you'd have no active Trend in the moment because
there's no hard closer so you wouldn't even have any Trends so you can't use this it's one of the rare cases where you do have I have to use the very top
of the entirety because there's nothing there and actually the highest time frame you can find there is something
there it's on the four hour it doesn't have to be established on the weekly or the monthly or anything like that so it's actually established on the four
hour so if you were to use a four hour candle here finding the highest time frame you would have had something like
come on oh come on you would have had this
come on to this and then your Trend work starts back here to here and and so you
start here as you're starting point on the four hour
Turn Down music a bit oh sure I've actually forgot to turn it off it shouldn't even be on right now um it's very low on my speakers
so your highest time frame that you'd have here is the four hour I just mark it green just because I like I said yesterday I'm just going to leave it
green just because it's cool to have it green for no reason so that's all that you have is this on the four hour okay
so then when you're going here that's where you get this right here you have four hour to four hour
that's where you get this right here so this this should be yellow if you guys are marking it it should be yellow
we cleaned a weekly accumulation kennel so you're looking at like this right here
you're looking at this right here which is already hard closed and broken so I know yeah that that I was using in the past as well prior to it being hard
closed yeah this is what I was using as well prior to being hard closed because it has already hard closed and then you
just so what do you do delete this and have nothing left well you have a four hour rate here you do have the four to
the four right here so the weekly was fine but once you create this top like that
you do have another trend it's just that it's the four hour to the
four hour which is perfectly fine it doesn't have to be the highest time frame
but there's nothing left after this like you would just be moving down in time frames after this
okay good it makes sense now because you don't have to use the weekly to the weekly I think that's where
that would have came in and you would have had like this right here this would have actually been your
weekly to weekly would have been like this right here so so this would have been it and that hard close
he doesn't give you anything left so if you're using this to this actually this would have been the correct Trend not
that one so if you're going weekly to weekly you would have been using this on a smaller time frame and then it gives you
this on the bigger time frame which is fine so this would have been maybe like a four hour or possibly a daily at first
which is fine and then it would have been right here and then you hard close it so you don't have anything left so
simply not even a valid Trend anymore instead all we have to do now is dig upwards in time frames you have to go
like this and you see okay no there's nothing daily here
Emma oh we have a four hour sweet so then you have your four hour Trend because again it just it doesn't have to
be the highest time frame we have to do that work to find it
hopefully that makes sense any questions left with that one fredly hopefully that's um if there's any questions feel free to
ask but uh I think I think that should probably cover it but uh yeah anything at all just ask away about that trend
the highest that's available yes exactly it's the highest it's available
and kind of the key thing here is that if you were using the weekly to weekly it would no longer be active because
quite some like simply put you would have this it hard closes and there's nothing left
there's nothing left you'd have this but that's it like that's the candle for the hard clothes actually you'd have this
like this that's the candle to the hard clothes that's it and we don't use that kind of backside Trend so that that's like you
see what I mean like you wouldn't have anything left like there's there's nothing to adapt this to so simply you just have to use a higher time frame
trend it's just showing you more weakness of the move uh if if you were in this moment here
you'd have two Trends to pass so you rewind back to here
and this would dictate okay you've got two trends that actually need to hard close so you could still be in a moment
where okay fine you created the four by breaking over the weekly but maybe you fall straight down and you don't hard
close up here well fine then you have two Trends which makes the movie even stronger means you have to close this one and this one so just make the move
stronger but in this case we did hard close it so and like maybe in this moment yeah okay this was still active
actually you would have had two Trends in this moment but then you you fast forward one week
come on where's this close here like okay maybe it was actually going to still be active here holy crap it's
still an active trend still an active Trend oh it's still active
you could have two Trends here and they're both active that's not no longer good now at that point it's just it's gone
you see what I mean
you'll have to watch a replay darn it dude any degree of a separation
for a trend hard clothes no uh depends what you mean by degree of separation but I'm going to say no is a flat answer
to that because we don't use Degrees of Separation there not in the way that I'm thinking you're referring it to but maybe you have
more of a defined question or what do you I guess what do you mean
by that okay you type that there's always a reason when we know the rules of the game there nothing can exist
outside of the rules there's not a like do you mean oh here's an hourly it has to close on the 15 and
the five or here's an hourly it has to close to the four and the 12th like Degrees of Separation like that where it has to close no if that's what you mean
no single moment in these charts trust me I've looked for for 10 years there's not
a single well maybe at this level of knowledge I've looked for at least five
I've done my due Dylan there's not a single move that happens outside of the rules it's just you know you're the
referee right like you have to enforce these rules yes just just getting out of that trade nine
percent which one where okay yeah I'm sure on the screen they're
short from 7 to 30 are just getting out where you could see the fair though you're still nine percent you know yep
yep
it's such an important part yes until the 15 is developed that you bet yes getting this entry because because if
you if you have best entry on it like this is such a beautiful thing in trading the most beautiful moment happens is when you have
best entry the reach controls at the base creates any one tree that you have best entry on
you literally can't lose the five would break and it would try to create a 15. it doesn't mean you make money it just
means you lose time so so this is something I I talk about when I develop AIX at the highest level like
what's the worst case scenarios that we lose time because time becomes our our value here because we can enter these
propositions all day long or we have the risk is zero the risk is our time and if
we're constantly wrong we're not making money so that's kind of like the striving point to get towards is where you where you constantly have zero risk
Trading the worst case scenario becomes oh man I just lost the game I didn't make any money but I think I think there there
comes a point where gone are the days of oh I had a losing day unless you really make some some
silly mistakes like you can still have losses because the level gets blown right through and you didn't do your job properly but but really if you always do
your job properly there there is no hey I lost money this day I made money
that day oh the four hour I lost time yeah yeah unless there's a different Trend that's
overarching into where all these perfect if you were just looking at only that Trend the four hour but there could be other Trends there could be whole levels
below it above it right catch every top at the highest level catch every bottom at the lowest level and nothing in between right like don't ever get
anything in between if you do it's a mistake so so if if you can do that like you
guys see me do it all the time down to the dollar two dollars but that that's my whole thing is like if I if I can Master the tops and bottoms I'll never
I'll never lose money I'll just lose time but again I I think that's the highest form of trading I don't think there's a higher form of trading not
that I've seen um catching the tops and bottoms is the highest form of trading because there's technically no better
entry right so are you are you are you uh pinning that statement to every time
frame I was attached the top and bottom of the 15 minutes I passed the top and bottom of the hour I'll do it on the
four uh everyone yeah even on the minute yeah absolutely that's why I always say like if we're not in a trade because we
missed something no big deal there's there's like literally tops and bottoms are everywhere they're absolutely everywhere like even even
right now this could be the three hard close of five I'd have to see
an example of it to clarify that with that properly but I would say no looks like we've got just as up here blanket
statement wants to close a five that's holding right now
um maybe quickly going and check that delete some of these other Trends here but there could be other
factors in play that you're missing so sometimes a three closing a five might be it if there's something else happening on the chart that you're not
seeing your other Trends and we'll just use one Trend but for for purposes of answering that question with accuracy I
would just say five to five after and just nothing below that five can close it type away Scandal this one right here
one right there yeah so as suspected that's what's happening um it's trying to break this trend
on a different time frame that we can't see this is going to be the
ladder point right ladder point to ladder Point prior to this being hit so this would have created the ladder from
here to here which encompasses this piece of the move here so so this is like the the first one would have been
here but I can see that one is already broken you can you can see that that was broken and then it created this and then
and then yes exactly about to break this wasn't the creation of the latter point this is the the latter point to here is
to here but this was created off of this so that's the trend that it failed to break to create its move up so I would
see this to this as what's holding the move down and actually that is what it is it's holding the move down right there even locally in the moment
that's more advanced laddering stuff we haven't gone over that yet but but we will um soon so there's there's no worry
on that so technically this could have been best entry because it could have just been Trend right yeah yeah sorry I keep
messing with this putting it into there no no worries we're still laddering right we're still in that moment where it's like ladder
it's a ladder it's a ladder right we're still at that moment right now we talked about this like most of the
most of the Traders here don't really know that they're creating a lotto no
see that's that's what I was talking about like this could still technically hold the move right here
remember when I said as long as there's going to be a level there that could technically hold it that's what you're seeing right now so we talked about this
level technically we can still hold it because it's still creating a ladder from here right
and that's what so that's what you're seeing right now like I said that you can always explain it it is just that how good are your rules because this is
the moment we looked for earlier where we said okay you know these people who are training here don't
know that they're creating this no no they don't they don't know what what is happening is that
biggest and best traders in the world are looking at all these pieces and saying this is where we short this is
where we long X's and O's right and and they let everybody else create the moments between whatever happens here
between you're gonna have some traders who see like okay for example this level being hit here will represent the bottom
of some kind of ma being bought for example so maybe like an ma25 on the 15 minute this level is going to represent
that because all all right all those data point averaging that people are using are just creating these in between
moments right so so all these weird indicators the macd that this of that on some time frame they're creating
so people are buying that and then the real Traders are are analyzing the signs at this level right like the couple of
us that are in the world are doing it this way and then we're saying okay you guys created this for us now the big
money because this is all little money like if big money yeah so the active the
active positions like you spoke about are sit and watching all of these what
you might call bad trades creating the entry points but they are good trades
yep creating the science eventually if you keep messing mucking around out here you're gonna have some big four hour
Trend out here or maybe some daily Trend out here and that's when you see Trend breaks and it's like burnt
it's done because that's where the lungs are exiting they're either exiting there on that Circle or they're exiting here
on this X and really nothing in between so so 99 of the market is bringing us to our science points and then and then the
one percent is deciding what happens but but therefore leading to your one percent of the mark of the money controlling 99 of the market because
that one percent represents 99 of the money in the market right yeah yeah yeah yeah
it's really interesting theoretical standpoint when you just talk about the uh the theory of it it's
it's very it's very interesting it's almost like a book like you can you can I guess I'm a little weird like that but
it's almost like you're watching a story being told right like it's almost like yeah make it make up your own story in this like that that's kind of the beauty
of this all is like it has this story it went to be a couple of big Traders there and just crossed my mind a few
times there's let's say the the guy with the biggest shark that's sitting up there at 72 70 yards and he's weird and
he's would he put the size of a lung on to get a crowd cheers to bring it up and
then really you know put 10 times that I'm sure oh yeah that happens all the time you see big
I've seen them as big as 2 000 Bitcoin in in the book just that a weird arbitrary level like all the seniors to
shove the crowd into their big Direction you'll just see somebody pop 800 Bitcoin on the books right there and and then
another one behind it for another 1200 right so so yeah because when you have that kind of money you have the power to
get into those levels but that doesn't mean you can manipulate the market it just means you're just speeding up
what's already going to happen anyways right yes but that was I I wondered uh where the people out there with that
capability that they could push it on to where they really wanted to go yeah absolutely yeah only to a certain point
though because then the real Traders like if one guy's pushing it up here and the other guy says uh-uh I'm gonna short
this if you want to log it you can take your chances and I'll take all your money like he's not going to do it he got to 5000 Bitcoin or whatever is in
his account for a reason and he's not going to squander for his ego right because there becomes a point where we just don't care because the the money we
make there is no ego this is like well for Christ's sakes I make x amount of figures per month I don't need you know
how much do I want I I yeah I make as much as I want I don't need to egotistically be right right you know
what I mean there's no there's no ego when you're talking about that kind of money it's just you either have it or you don't yeah yeah yeah there's no ego
there's no Bragging Rights it's just hey I've got it I don't care they're really good ones that don't even
let people know that they're dirty good ones exactly
and the only reason I found this whole level is because I realized it was the level over top of the latter point right
so it's kind of like a hidden level it's the level over over top of a ladder point so as long as this can continue to hold technically it's still laddering
it's when this starts to break is when you know you'll see a lower range attack then you you I would almost say like
maybe you could even go here yeah I guess you could I guess you could
because then that's just going to hold the level through the trend like you could go there any lower than that and you're kind of
back down in a smaller range like any any moment under this you you know you're down in here
backside here maybe like you you're somewhere in a different range at that point you're in a different piece of the move at that point you know what I mean
like oh yeah you reset your brain on what you're intentions yeah exactly you're not you're no longer pushing a
range to have a move up right you're you're kind of holding a move to set up something longer so it kind of shifts the
correlation of what's to happen in the future right now you're just simply developing a range up top like you're
just holding the high range like that I always say those words like we're just holding a high range right that's all yeah you know as long as you continue to
hold this eventually you'll just break these trends that are created you just have to continue to hold this it could take all day we could just sit here and hold all day but eventually it'll create
another little Trend here and another little Trend here and here and so so then you got to break this one and then you got to break this one and then you
gotta break this one but if it just continues to perpetually hold this you know this level here this is going to
hold right through every single Trend it could ever possibly make and then it just moves up until it gets there uh you
know in terms of fragility are we in a fragile area here because
so I would I would shift that term fragile to polarized so I I give that term Fragile the move
is fragile that's a good way for people to at first I think that's important to talk about
for a second when Pat says how fragile is this move I think people
cling on to that word fragility as some measurement of one two three four five six seven eight nine ten how fragile is
something which is fair because I do talk about that from time to time where I say that well this is move it's fragile but also to realize that it's
it's more of a polarized moment now and less about being quote unquote fragile
it's it's not about which in a way is the same thing but polarized the
difference being that if you understand that it's polarized the move just broke up okay let me make sure my mouse is on
the screen here the move broker range from back here so so this actually broke a range here like this range is broken
and it's moving up so what it's doing is it's trying to test the larger rain range so
it's more of a polarized at a fragile moment because a fragile moment means it could just collapse at any moment and
and it would have to have an excuse to collapse you'd have to have a reason like it tests the higher level and
breaks down which would just be more of a polarized moment because
this is whatever for our whole level and it's been holding for a long time so all of this range work that it had been
doing to break the move up to attack this four hour level or whatever level is the one hour whatever whatever we uh
did the work yesterday and found the level whatever that level was it's more about that's a large value that has held
it down for a Long Point so it's more polarized because if it goes over this then it's extremely polarized to attack
a much larger range it's breaking a four hour level which is huge right it's going to go after a pretty it's going to take something pretty pretty big to
offset that so you know that term fragile doesn't really have any purpose to it it not that's a bad way to
put it it's not that it doesn't have purpose it doesn't it doesn't have the correct weight fragile kind of just means that
something is ready to break and it's attacked the level so many
times that it's becoming very fragile it's ready to break it's the glass has been dropped so many times and it's
starting to crack but that's not the case here this is this is more of a four hour level being a polarized moment so
it's an important distinction to make because it's not like you've been hitting this four hour level time after time it's headed its through it it's
reversed it it has whole levels that makes it fragile making something fragile is like okay it hasn't been
tested yet it's not very fragile but in in reality this could hit the four hour level it could pull back or it could go
through the four hour through the four hour level pullback created as a reverse hit the reverse create a whole level off
the reverse on the one hour and a 15 minute break the one hour attack the 15
um by hitting the four again as a reverse which makes the 15 a reverse but you haven't hit the reverse 15 after hitting all those other levels that
would make it more fragile instead of polarized as to where this is very much a polarized moment so there's a bit of a
difference there between a move being fragile because it's it's been weakened versus polarity in the
charts where this is representing a four-hour ladder point that has continued to hit four hour four hour four hour four hour for the past six
months that's more of a polarized moment because it could it could be the polarity to Breaking the move up instead
of being fragile so that's just kind of an important distinction to make when something is fragile versus when it's
polarized understand that a move can can have it's like understanding polarity
before you understand it because fragile means oh it's like glass it could shatter any second that's fine Jesus
defining a large grouping of understanding so you're allowing people to understand that these moves they can
shatter like glass and all of a sudden it can just be gone if you were to to refine fragility it
would be polarization it would be here and here so it's very acute moments so so fragile is this and and this those
are fragile moments fragile yes yes it's going one way or
the other yeah fragile is like a a blanket term and and and and in order to
understand polarity you know your months of mentorship with cotton because that's something that's fragile you you use
that terminology fragile this makes sense to let people know that hey there's certain times where where
something can just break so so be careful it's like a caution sign but then it doesn't tell you what's ahead it's just like a blank caution sign like
caution something could possibly happen ahead and you know you replace that sign with a pothole sign
um watch out for potholes on the right you know that's what this is it's like oh watch out for this level on at this
time in this moment it's more like replace that idea of Fragile with polarized and start looking for
polarized moments moments that break larger pieces of the chart give you Acuity right like this is 100x this is
100x so so you know even that's why I said earlier stay at 50x because you have to
understand what's you know what what uh polarization yeah and and uh yeah I'm not there I'm not there but but but once
you understand polarization you can 100 Access level and if it goes Ascent over or just holds like right here you just
get out with no losses and if it rejects you just make double the profits so so there's really no downside of 100xing the downside of 100xing is hey you've
got to know how to trade properly or these higher level trading right
well I'll keep walking towards and I may get to the 100x points yeah yep yep yeah don't rush it don't rush it you can make
more money than you know what to do with a 50x and you don't have to have the stress because 100x is stressful because then you have to be accurate every
single time like it's very stressful but it doubles it literally doubles your income right like literally doubles your
income my My Philosophy on this is you know I'll take this to where I'm as good as I
can be on you know at the clinic and my money again at a particular level then so be it you know you will be more
profitable profitable and successful than 99 of Traders out there the only thing that 100x can do for you
is you have zero to 100 here in theory and your slider right now is here at 50x
rate in the middle in theory if you are making a hundred thousand dollars a year you could simply just
click this button and drag it over and all of a sudden you doubled your income but that only works that only works if
you're right this is the only thing doing 100x does it whatever income you're comfortable
making you can just double it you could just if you make 300 000 a year you could just make 600 000 a year just by simply
sliding a button but but you have to be right you know like you can you have to you really yeah you can do
not be getting liquidated on those 50x's if they were 100x right the accuracy has to be there to take that leap but but
when it's there if it ever gets there when it does if it does hey you can still make 300K a year or even maybe even 500k a year
or even maybe even a million dollars a year at 50x is possible it's absolutely possible you could actually probably make five million a year
if you notice the accuracy is there hey you can try it right like so so don't don't make it more than what it needs to
be 50 excess exactly exactly yeah and and you know that was a very useful tip you give me at the top of the call
because you know every trade now I will go and examine and say well I've got to go 100x what would have happened here
yep absolutely it's just a good way to look at it just start analyzing every trade and because
it's not it's not the fact that you're working towards 100x what that does like we said it it allows you to see where you were wrong and not you know you can
still make money and be wrong you were wrong at 72. it's refining your educational problems if you like what
you know you were you were wrong at 72 30 but you still made money on it you were only wrong and it's in the sense
that you were you could have gotten higher yeah so in a technical sense you were wrong and you still made money
that's a great that's a great feeling no you're not doing the right thing and you're still making money imagine what
you can do when you are right around I'm a millionaire okay video done
let's get to you still in the grocery store oh the one with ice let's get to the current time frame
of Bitcoin and what it's doing okay do we have questions about ranges so far
I kind of did a pretty good breakdown Midway but let's let's tackle questions first and uh see what stems out of that
those big Wicks do they set a new Range like reset the previous one it had just blasted through give me an example MD
when you say big Wicks what do you mean I know what you mean but uh you mean
something like this like this one right here
this be an example maybe I think so right so you have a bigger range here so let's just remember this green is a four
hour you have a bigger range there what you'd want to do is you can create like realize that this range is controlling a
much larger part of the move so you can have no not that okay
maybe give me an example but I'll explain this anyways you can have a larger range controlling the chart and
then this would be a smaller range so there's no problem with making a daily Trend like this over top of a
like that there's no there's no problem with making a daily Trend over top of a weekly Trend or a larger time frame
Trend that's perfectly fine if the chart allows it it allows it and in this example I think you would be using four
hour here and you don't have a four hour there so what about the one hour yeah you have the one hour so you actually
have your one hour Trend right here right like you can leave that as the four
you can actually even leave it as the daily come on you can leave it as a daily go
here to the one hour like this and you have your Trend right and then that breaks and hard closes right here and I
don't think this was a four was it we didn't skip over everything no we didn't but instead what we have is we have a
larger time frame Trend now so like in this moment here prior to this happening it's kind of
you're getting into the same pattern as you did before and you're like oh we've got a one-hour Trend and you just leave that and forget about it and meanwhile
you may have missed something if you don't have any dailies there you do but you would have had a four hour first and
and you actually do get like a four hour Trend right here from here to here right so you do actually get a four hour Trend
like this which hard closes to here so you could have left this as the hourly but what you would have been doing is
you would have it almost like set it and forget it is what you forgot you forgot to adapt it out on different time frames
because you would have had it here on the hourly right and then this moment creates and you would have been like oh we're
breaking Trend but what you didn't do was you actually didn't go and adjust it on the time frame to the four so it's
even though it's the same point you don't have the four hour hard close so you actually don't have the hard close yet
so that's okay to have like oh daily to four right here or even daily to daily which would have been
oopsies would have been here and there's no hard clothes so actually that's why I just pinned it to the
second one because you would have eventually ended up just right here you would have just ended up here anyways same time friend stop time friend oh my
God same time frame daily to four but if you would have done this on the one hour to begin with up at this point here now
that would have been great up until this moment here that would have been active and all perfect and everything is good
but you forgot to do your other work it's like you left it and never changed it and never went back to look through the time frames over time as it creates
bigger time frames so that would have been the problem if you would have done it there so that's going to tackle one question regardless if that's what you
meant wmd I know it's not but that's going to tackle one large question that will inevitably come up
then jcap says um MD if you want to maybe describe more use more words I
might be able to understand better or a picture I could understand better and re-tackle your question but anyways that was a good one
um okay so Jacob says so your first step would be to create a Pandora's Box and then start moving down let's pick a
random spot yeah this looks good so you're saying like oh we would create a Pandora's Box uh no we don't want to
write what exit three player no okay so like you start here um let's not worry Let's Pretend This is the top of the
move right Let's Pretend This is the top of the move and uh you need to create something right so obviously you have
nothing to create yet we're just going to let this play through we're gonna leave it on the four hour for this example like how would you start this
you don't have anything here yet so like if you're saying Pandora's Box that's
the assumption that you would be using the very top and the very bottom which is true once it's developed instead you
would have actually had like this right now four hour to four hour which would have been here originally which hard
closed over there like I don't need to do this to understand that this is going to be the four to four right here like that that's the rate that's the trend range that needs to break okay so let's
mark this as let's let's get this weird dotted Gray Line off because it's not really communicating what we wanted to
I think MD was talking about in The 58k reigns that got Wicked through on October 28th
okay let's do this first so this is the first thing you'd have and then if you were going to Pandora's
Box it like right now your Pandora's Box would be from here to here right like this would be your Pandora's Box and you
don't have anything up here so you'd actually have to break this range first you'd have to break this range to create something for this to actually start
that Pandora's Box process up here this doesn't have it yet but to be fair it's the middle of a move so we can't really sit here and say oh
um here's the middle of a move it's you like this is the middle of a move on a bigger time frame so we can't there's
nothing to create here so okay so you you break your move there you hard close and move down
so this would be here now let's make sure we didn't miss anything on the daily let's make sure we don't have a daily daily which we do so you let's add
a second Trend just so you for example say Karen let's color it we're going to add two Trends here
go back to the four hour okay so you have
new trends here at this point you could create that
larger Trend now now you're kind of in that Pandora's box right here right and
you would also want to check the daily make sure you don't have anything it's daily to daily rate though come on
daily to daily right there
hard close there's a move up so now you're just going after higher Parts accumulation cycle and that's where
you'd start that's how you'd have to start that Pandora's Box like you have to you have to start on on the bottom and
the top but you have to break the interior range in order to create some kind of cycle that could be accumulation distribution cycle right against the
larger time frames like even here you're not even testing the level yet so who's to say you're not just going to test the level and fall down right or create a
trend and then break the move completely as it did here right now you'd say which trend is correct on the other side well I think it's pretty easy to tell that
the four hour is giving you more accurate information because most people they're going to do this and they're just going to go bottom even if they
know range work they're just going to go bottom to bottom and that's it but there's an earlier sign here which is that four hour which is why we use that
four hour here from here to here because once you lose that Trend the move is gone and then I guess whatever
I don't know whatever this is out to okay that's where we created the next range so that Pandora's Box it has to break that like the Pandora's Box where
it is in the moment like you were here jcap
Pandora's Box in this moment doesn't really have anything to do with this it can't be really like in an overarching
schema where the the possible top of the range is yes but irrelevant to the moment you've got this
that has to break prior to creating anything else because you could be sitting at the top of this move and saying oh
Pandora's Box is up here because it's a whole level and never hit it and be sitting there wondering like why right and you could just be sitting
there wondering why because you weren't really looking at oh my God I hit the space bar that's okay anyways I think you get the point
where you had an issue with your internet uh so that would have to hard close that Wick like let's see what this is
so like right here you're looking at this and depending on where your range is on other time frames like this big wick what was your original question
original question was those big Wicks did they set a new Range
the heart close is set a new Range the bit the big Wicks don't do anything no the big wick doesn't do anything there
uh what is this on November 3rd on the 15.
there's some big oh yeah like right here okay this is what you're looking at so like okay
no this doesn't do anything so like we can delete a lot of this
other stuff just so we can clear this up this doesn't do anything let's start with that you like some range work on the higher time frame so you have your
your larger range here which is fine and then you would have like you don't have anything here you
would have this has to connect your legacy Global local so like if you were to do this it would be right here if you
were to do that it would be right there right but you need to go down in time frames to see where this is actually
like what's what's happening here so reverse level here so you can Mark everything out like if you were to do
this reverse level oh God it's purple we don't want that anything but purple so I don't want this color to be confused
with the weekly okay so you'd have like a reverse level here and uh then you would have
like you range from back here this green line that goes through and and you would have your what did we Mark the four hour
there's no there's a four hour you almost have to start from back here because you'd have this which connects
that so this is still your like this is still your trend from this point to this point like it's almost like the same
exact Trend so what you'd have to do is you'd have to go to a lower time frame now to find maybe I can use a replay tool to better
demonstrate this see it has to go to like a lower time frame to Define where that range is so let's go and see what we have so you have an hourly rate here
right so you have like this hourly rate here which gets closed to that so you'd have
this right here right close that pulls back probably creates
the bigger time frame which I'm just going to hit play here for a second yep it does it creates a bigger time frame
right here and that heart closes to here so now you'd actually have your your range so this would be your four hour to
four hour range rate here so that it has to hard close this walk through this move
there's a hard close so now you'd be here right
I'm assuming that Wick is coming soon here right there tried to break the range so that's where your four to four hour
would be which if you follow the trail of how it works it's exactly what it is right and that's the trend you'd need to
close so those like those big Wicks they don't I guess what's the question though
do they set a new Range no not unless it's just if it was a distribution candle that hard closed yes so to answer
your question only if it's a distribution candle that creates a hard close
like only if it was this criteria here and then so you're here
right which may have been daily here it looks like that's maybe daily there
can't be here right you're still above the other trend
simply just above your other trend collapse do we Trend work
range Trends using range Trends or do we I haven't updated my chart though thanks
for the answer yeah only if it hard closes MD okay let me get back to Tyler's question here so okay to see a move collapse do we
do Trend work using these range Trends or we do something like it was taught in the trend collapse video where you see a
lower time frame break a higher time frame Trend than a rate are we okay to do the same thing so
if my question doesn't make sense no I think I think I know what you mean so I say before that
you can um do you remember what lesson it was by chance probably not I think it's in future of trading in Cycles
I think it no it's not always connected to a trend the bottom of a range always connected to a trend no they can be
independent like over here that example I did with jcap was not connected like this is not
connected but it's the range of the actual part of that move it's it's but it's not connected so no they don't have
to be connected so when you're talking about Tyler when you're talking about breaking time frames
um okay let's delete this stuff here and here
come on let's delete that let's delete that this is the daily hold level we can leave that that could be relevant for the future let's leave this where's that
Weekly level I want to keep that one up that Weekly level is here right now looks like it's going to be here today which is fine that's
perfectly fine but we're not there yet so you're talking about uh let's let's just create
like a a trend right here like this but you're talking about and go to the
replayer tool just want to make sure I understand what you're asking me you're talking about like this and
you're saying okay the one hour has to hard close it
at first okay one hour hard close good perfect and then you go down to the 15 does the
15 you you adapt that to the 15. that's what you're referring to right Tyler how we would now take this trend and move it
like that and now we have to break the 15. I believe this is what you're referring to
yes okay so what's happening here is this is accurate but what's happening as
you're going down time frames like that is you're confirming bigger pieces of the move so you see how we've already confirmed the hourly and then
um oh where's that reach point so then you would say okay that that breaks there where's the 15 minute hard close
so then the 15 minute hard close would go like this where's that reach point and then the 15 would go from here to
here right like you're doing this and then like if we swap back to the four hour this is showing you how it's
breaking so now I need to re-add the four hour as a comparative so now you see how we haven't quite hard closed it
yet but what we're doing is we're cycling down and breaking time frames well what this is doing now because now
we broke the 15 here right so what this is doing over time is it's a confirmation inside of a hard close so
now you're getting one layer deeper into confirming the breaking of a move so now you're on a five minute right and then
and then so let's break this five minute all right closes five minute
oh that was close dude there it is right there hard close five minute that one actually hard close
I did now I hopefully I pinned these all right because then you start getting into like really nitty points of accuracy so now we have to go here and
card close the three minute over top of that now you're like okay hard close the
three minute here right so so now what you're getting into is like the one minute hard close has to be over top of
this and the one minute should pump it and that should in theory break that four yep there it is right there so this in
theory should now be broken over the four hour right like oh look at the time frame when you son of a b it's rated
that that four hour mark too so what you're seeing is as you cycle down those time frames what you're seeing is the
hard close breaking of a four hour so that's a really good question because it's a little more advanced than what I would expect anybody to know yet but uh
good on you Tyler for picking on picking up on that what you're seeing is that original four hour hard close let's turn
this yellow you're seeing the process of it actually Breaking Inside of this candle by cycling down
you see what I mean so what you're seeing is you're seeing the four hour hard close is confirming over time so it
hasn't quite hard closed a four hour yet but it is now using all these smaller
time frames and it's recycling itself into its final break point almost think of this as like a final hold level for
trends I think this is one of the first times somebody's commented about something
that I've planned on talking about in Butterfly Effect 2 directly pretty cool
maybe I've said this before but I remember one time you said sometimes we don't use external
downtrends I remember one time you said that sometimes we don't use external downtrend unless we're in an
accumulation cycle don't use an external downtrend let me think about what you're saying here for
a second don't use an external downtrend
let's draw this so I can visualize it because I don't know if I'm understanding this so an external downtrend would be like this we don't
use an external downtrend what unless we're in an accumulation cycle
so we'd have to be in an accumulation cycle they use an external external downtrend
so that means that in order to use this and re-adapt it would have to be an accumulation cycle
meaning that we're breaking up and so we're not using this yeah that would be true
but that's kind of like exactly what it is what uh maybe I'm missing something here external versus interior
so we use both but we have to use interior prior to external and external can't exist unless
interior moments break and interior moments are are creating the moments that attack exterior moments you can't
indeed use exterior downtrends while you're still in the interior components of the move so until you start an
accumulation cycle which would be breaking those interior moments you're not using downtrend so this would all be
true I just don't know if I'm missing something could you explain that a little more I'm
not sure if I catch on to that but I think it sounds self-explanatory but I think
I'm I think I'm not reading it right so like this trend can't be used until these
interior moments allow for it so okay this is actually a perfect example to tie with Tyler because you know what he asked a question that nobody should have
asked yet but that's okay um Tyler's in timeout but anyways that's okay it'll help you guys which is good
that's the point of this it's not to conceal butterfly effect to knowledge it's the point is to help you guys you
know so if the question is being asked it's important so you're breaking a four-hour level heart closing in on Lower time frames alternatively if you
were having a 15-minute Trend then you would use the five and the three and the one to see the breaking process of that
the process of how something breaks but that would be your interior moment mijo that you're talking about where you have
an exterior Trend this has to create an exterior cycle so the interior moment would be the breaking of this four-hour
Trend and that's how you would see the breaking of the trend so it's kind of interesting how those two back-to-back questions kind of tie together as to
where this interior moment it wouldn't have to be broken on its time frame by decycling or recycling
down through interior moments in order to create that exterior moment because this
can't be used yet until that interior moment has passed and that interior moment is recycled down into smaller and
smaller frames of confirmation right like a four hour it can confirm on a one hour can confirm on a 15 and it only
kind of makes sense if you think about an illogical way as to where four hours of time span is
this much right and if you had an hour uh hard close you would need one hour in
there would take this much time to do it because it may take two or three hours so actually if that was one hour and it actually took two hours to confirm you
would take up this much time in your four hour time frame and then it needs a bunch of 15 minute blocks in order to
confirm that and you're getting closer to that four hour demise that close of that four four hours so if this is the
one hour right here and here and it actually took two hours there and this 15 minute took four candles and that was another third hour so now you're three
hours in and then maybe you have like uh five minutes they they Encompass the most part of an hour and then three minutes and then a one minute and then
boom it pops and then and then and then you get the hard clothes for hour but that's how you see it is it's the recycling or the decycling of those
smaller time frames that are all accompanied all accompanying each other or all combined together to create that four
hour frame so then that whole entire frame that's existing in that four hour period where you have smaller blocks or
components inside of it that's created by you have a trend you start confirming smaller time frames and you start moving
down like four to one to Fifteen and it's also where you start thinking of Degrees of Separation while the four hour can have multiple Degrees of
Separation before it breaks it can have two degrees like I've said this in the past it could have two degrees of separation
so that means it can go hourly 15. after those two degrees of separation you're very close to Breaking the move because
you've already decycled the one hour the 15 it's moving up it's breaking trans you're running out of time in that four hour frame so you see how it kind of all
just makes sense in terms of a horizontal a vertical axis that has
pieces that live inside of each other almost like Pandora's box across Theory right like pieces that decycle
themselves into each other hopefully that all made sense that was like a lot of questions kind of combined
into one explanation but I think these are the things about trends that people need to see and know and I think these are these hard-hitting questions that
people that they they have that like that's that hard-hitting stuff that really
drives it home
my brain is fried after that question a little bit
fried in a good way I think of it as each smaller break is
the bigger Trend losing health bar yes exactly when that breaks there are holds still in in the
existence it can create a bigger one and that process can start over from the one minute up yes this is exactly true like
and it can be as small as a one minute time frame because imagine polarity exists inside of this Frame and where
would polarity exist polarity would exist when the health bar gets down to zero or when those time frames compile
and compile and compile and there's this little stupid one minute hold left that looks like a two there's a stupid little
one minute hold left right at the four hour cusp and this holds it and this is such polarity and you can see why
because it's about to cross that four hour mark and it's about to break because it's a final Trend and it's a final hold level but this effing thing
holds and then that whole entire attack collapses right so that's what happens
sometimes so that that's where you get these final holds final lows moments of polarity like they exist everywhere but
across different theories they exist so this is a pretty cool way to look at it like in DACA health bar with what kind
of you know there's like these little slivers left and those are you know often seen as polarity the the tiniest
sliver that's in the very cusp of that four hour or you've done all this work imagine it's like you're climbing up a
hill and you're running out of energy you're like your health bar thing you're climbing up Bell and you're running any you think you're at the top and then you
know you're either the mountain looks like this the mountain looks like this and it's got like you know whatever here and oh you're at the top of the mountain
and you're you're here and you've done all this work four hours you've been climbing this thing and you get to hear and you're about to see the top and you're like holy and then you don't
realize that there's another like 50 miles and you're like I'm dead roll down the hill kind of like the same thing health bar like you know top of the hill
final moment yeah final hit on the Boston you die
and he just one shot to yeah freaking jiggle Peaks you on the option
sorry guys that's my Counter-Strike talk old days uh coming through
really great lesson today always cleared up for me I think I think this as a starting point for range work and for
how we use Trends with ranges and how to define Trends and let's do this one last time I think as a starting point to what
it looks like when we first start accurately using ranges and Trends
properly to understand what controls a move I think I go back to that same saying of control what is controlling a
move right and and you have these different cues and moves and start like this just go back to the same example
start by and let's do this on something else let's go to a stock let's go to like the s p sure yeah although this is
at an all-time high we can even start right now with doing some initial range work on the bottom so if we were on the
S P we could do our range work on the bottom and we could say okay like where do you start while you
you start by understanding that this right here is a range this is the range this is the whole level that's been hit
so this is the bottom of the move but like this is this is the bottom you can you can Define it by this Wick which is
back testing this level and you can say the range rate now exists like this to this so how do you start now you've
defined a range right you've defined the range and and where do you start so you would first start like this and say okay
like small time frame you're gonna have like this so this is like the smallest thing we have and we're going to work
forward up of course but regardless this is the whole level that was hit this is
the range that could be created and you were going to have other stuff back here we're just working on this one right now you are going to have overarching stuff
that may intersect and you may have something that goes like this unless you do your full work on this
chart you may have something oh come on dude may have something that goes like this and completely intersects with you
with your current work like this and then heart closes out to here and it completely intersects
with what you have you see it completely intersects and it's like oh well what am I using so now you understand that once
this range breaks it can attack the back of that range right those larger range breaks this has to hold or you would
have kind of like this Gap from like okay you break down this has to hold and if it can't hold then you have to hold
this because this range is being attacked so if the interior range is breaking it's actually going after the
bottom of this range so you find the whole level here now and you understand where it goes so maybe like right here so then it goes here so you you lose
this level you go to you go to here right so that that's like ranges can intersect because you are going to have
this here but the first thing you do is you define the range right and that's
another whole interesting lesson in itself how rangers attack each other which again of course we get into in the future but that's a very cool lesson
because then you can see these Market gaps and those cool pieces but I think I just showed that little example to kind of just oh my God it makes sense like
and of course because then this range would attack this level after breaking
this range here it would attack this level which is untested and then you'd have this becoming oh
come on oops wrong Point Jesus cotton dude man then you'd have this to this
which is the same thing as you have right here so it's just this this pattern has repeated itself and then there'd be a larger impeding range that
once that range is broken it can attack this range and so forth and so forth so we're not going to get into that because that's just like a whole thing we'll be
here all day and I do have a stream today so like we in a second stream so we we Define the
range we we find the range itself we Define the trend and now we look for the levels holding up
the move okay so now you have this is kind of already tested it is it's not really a reverse this here uh test it's
very simple and I'm not going to switch too much time frames here daily uh very simple like a daily level untested hold
you could always cycle it down to the four hours see where there's a reverse you can go down here you find this as the reverse this could allow to the move
so indeed actually the bottom of this would be here which could be the reverse level oh it's actually already tested you see how it breaks through and back
test that so it can't be this so that means this would be your next level to be tested which is already tested there
because it's member candle or Wick so whether you want to go for the greediest point or not is already tested here so your rate here which maybe is the daily
as well question mark so it's a little deeper in the daily so you can hit the the daily here right here come on and
then we can see where the top of the wick of the four is so so at what point can you combine all things the other back side for daily so backside four
looks good here because the backside four is also testing that four hour Valley which can be the backside side if you wanted to get really super greedy
without being too greedy you could go to the actual Wick which means you've tested the backside for the four hour and the daily all-in-one swoop now it
may not go down to 41.87 you may want to just go to the back side here come on
dude 41.93 you may want to go to Just 4204 because it's such a round number you may want to front run this 41 95 30
and you may say hey I might as well go forward you 201 and at that point you might as well go 4204 420 205. call it
4210 if you want so you have this whole decision process that you need to make in there what level is going to be
attacked but now at least you've defined you know take this away and this looks pretty smart here 41.93 now you've
defined the range and the level of the range the range level so now you've kind of defined the final moments and then
inside of smaller time frames those moments that it could possibly happen we didn't even do the weekly which is a mistake we should always start from Top
time frame down that Weekly is tested bottom here test inside of that yeah that looks good so so at least we've
defined the three pieces on the bottom of this that we kind of need to see right now the range the level itself and
and the range Trend so that the trend that's holding the move and this can be defined further in the future
um move down in time frame daily I wonder if you can Define it from
here on a lower time frame it's it's actually quite possible that you can actually Define this a little smarter
here so you start with the daily oh my God being zoomed in sucks you go
there you go here you go here you go here there's your range so we
actually made a mistake so so you see how I kind of just marked something and I was like bottom to bottom
that's not correct here here
this one doesn't break does it no it doesn't see it's still slightly over in that top
corner to here and now you have
what's holding up the move it's also possibly just this whole level here but it's a good it's a good it's a good Confluence anyways like it's
almost think of it like two whole levels holding up the move right like be pretty tough for it to break that so this is
the start of the rain this is the start of the level it attacks it and holds it it doesn't hard close it so there's no reason to start the trend here actually
we started the trend in the right spot right here we would have had this trend right here which was I believe right here and then
it adapted to here this trend broke it hard closed right so you'd have this here
and also have this year but you don't have it daily that's the problem with this one so you actually have to use a different time
frame on this here to here there to here
there here you have two two Trends there right you have this one to this one right here if
you hard close it properly which you get your break there it's your second break there and then you can move this one to here
is your daily range right so you have two ranges there so you have to you have two and then if you wanted to adapt them down you may find that they intersect
pretty uh adopted down they they intersect here a little bit but then then you have
better range work in this scenario I use this and the reason I would use this one is because this
hard closed its original Trend so it can create a new trend so while this may have been accurate in
certain moments now where we are right now you would be like oh we're on the far we'd have to go to the Daily
you see how this trend got hard closed that's how like right here it was uh right here in this moment it got hard
closed and this can't be a trend just like in our example before this cannot be a trend so we actually just start
from here to find the real range of the trend and then this we've adapted to the four hour because it did have that hard
close so it's a little more accurate you could leave it on the daily but maybe you would want to have two Trends here
if you feel that you need them because what you could do here is you'd have daily to daily which would be different than daily to four hour but the daily
broke and it didn't read hard because I believe the daily was here and then you had a four hour break right so you you'd
want to use and I guess it depends on what side of this thing you'd be on but you'd want to use the four hour wow what a lesson today Jesus
